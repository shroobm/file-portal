# 03 — Windows Widget

Lives in [`windows-widget/`](../windows-widget). Built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app) (Rust
backend, HTML/CSS/JS frontend) — chosen over WPF/Electron because the resulting binary is small,
the app can sit on the desktop as a borderless always-on-top window, and the UI layer is trivial to
restyle without touching the transfer logic.

## What it looks like

A small panel of "portal" tiles, each one a labeled drop zone:

```
┌───────────┐ ┌───────────┐ ┌───────────┐ ┌───────────┐
│ 📄 Docs    │ │ 🖼 Photos  │ │ 💻 Code   │ │ 📦 Archive │
└───────────┘ └───────────┘ └───────────┘ └───────────┘
```

Dragging a file from Explorer onto a tile sends it through that portal's category. Tiles and their
categories are defined in `config.rs`'s `AppConfig::default()` and loaded at runtime from
`%APPDATA%\file-portal\config.toml` (see [`portals.json`](../windows-widget/portals.json) for the
reference copy of the default set) — adding a new portal is a config change, not a code change.

## Responsibilities (and non-responsibilities)

The widget **does**:
- present drop targets and basic transfer feedback (queued / sending / done / failed),
- resolve native file paths from the OS drag-and-drop event,
- invoke the Rust `send_to_portal(category, paths)` command,
- shell out to `tailscale ssh <host>` and stream each file's bytes into a remote `cat >` — a `.part-` temp file, then an atomic `mv` into place (no `rsync`/`scp`).

The widget explicitly **does not**:
- decide the final destination folder on Linux — that's the allocator's job (see
  [`04-linux-receiver.md`](04-linux-receiver.md)),
- manage SSH keys or credentials — Tailscale SSH handles auth,
- run anything elevated — it only ever calls the `tailscale` CLI as the logged-in Windows user
  (the remote side needs only `cat`/`mkdir`/`mv`).

## Key files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.html` / `main.js` / `styles.css` | Portal UI, drag-and-drop handling, transfer status. |
| `src-tauri/src/main.rs` | Tauri commands (`list_portals`, `send_to_portal`), app state, entry point. |
| `src-tauri/src/config.rs` | Loads `%APPDATA%\file-portal\config.toml` (host, user, portals); creates defaults on first run. |
| `src-tauri/src/transfer.rs` | Streams files over `tailscale ssh` into a remote `cat >` (`.part-` temp + atomic `mv`); no `rsync`/`scp`. |
| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | Window config (borderless, always-on-top, size) and app metadata. |
| `portals.json` | Reference copy of the default portal set; not read at runtime (see `config.rs`). |

## Configuration

The Linux host alias and per-category inbox subpaths are read from
`%APPDATA%\file-portal\config.toml` at runtime (created with sane defaults on first launch — see
the `load_or_init` function in `config.rs`). This keeps host-specific details out of the
repo/binary.
