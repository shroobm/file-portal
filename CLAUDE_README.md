# CLAUDE_README — File Portal / Library Pipeline Mission Brief

*Read this file first when activating on any machine in this project. The Change Ledger below
the Status Summary owns "last updated" — there is deliberately no hand-typed date here.*

---

## Session Protocol — How Every Claude Uses This File

This file is the shared brain across sessions and machines. Follow this every time.

### 1. On Activation
```bash
git pull  # always first
```
- Read this file top to bottom
- Read the most recent entry in **Session Log** to understand where the last session ended

### 2. Before Starting Work
- Write your plan in **Current Session Plan** (replace whatever was there)
- Include: what you're planning to do, in what order, and how you'll verify each step
- Commit and push:
  ```bash
  git add CLAUDE_README.md
  git commit -m "session: open plan — [machine] [date]"
  git push
  ```

### 3. During Work
- Verify each step before moving on (test, lint, check output, confirm expected behavior)
- If the solution to a step changes from the plan, note the change and why inline

### 4. Before Closing the Session
- Move the current session plan to **Session Log** with a timestamp and outcome
- Update the machine's task list above (check off done items, add new ones)
- Write the concrete next steps so the next Claude can start immediately
- Run `git diff --name-only <last ledger SHA>..HEAD`. Every changed file must be accounted
  for: either it appears in a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, or it is a doc/protocol file listed in
  your new Change Ledger row. If a source file changed and no CHANGELOG entry describes it,
  write one before closing.
- Append your Change Ledger row **after** the closing commit is made, in a **one-line
  follow-up commit** — do NOT `git commit --amend` it into the closing commit: amending
  changes that commit's SHA and orphans the row you just wrote (discovered by doing exactly
  that, 2026-07-10). Never write a SHA you have not seen.
  (A ledger SHA that is not an ancestor of `HEAD` is a mechanically detectable lie — one
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor` call. That check is what caught the L6.5 status-feed
  regression, where `0c3a074` was never merged into the branch.)
- Commit and push:
  ```bash
  git add CLAUDE_README.md
  git commit -m "session: close — [machine] [date]"
  git push
  ```

## Current Session Plan

*Replace this section at the start of each session. Commit it before starting work.*

**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Desktop)
**Date:** 2026-07-19 (Session 25)
**Claude:** Claude Code / Fable

### What I'm planning to do (in order):
1. The "GPU → Vault" tile: local-move branch in `transfer.rs` (category `convert-gpu` → copy into `<gpu_pipeline_dir>\drop` with collision-safe naming), tile added to live config, JS skips the ThinkPad status poll for this category (the line strip is its status).
2. Rebuild, restart, drop-test, close.

### How I'll verify each step:
- Drop a PDF on the tile → file appears in drop\, watcher converts, line shows it; no allocator-poll noise.

### Dependencies / blockers:
- None.

## Status Summary

- ✅ File Portal v2 status feedback loop — Tauri v2 built (45s, 2 bundles), all 4 files committed
- ✅ `coordination/messages/` folder created in repo
- ✅ Desktop build report written and committed to `feat/library-pipeline`
- ✅ Branch `feat/library-pipeline` pushed to origin
- ✅ `CLAUDE_README.md` created with session protocol and pushed (this file)
- ✅ W1 atomic transfer — verified in committed code (transfer.rs: `.part-` tmp + `mv -f`)
- ✅ W2 streaming copy — verified in committed code (`std::io::copy`, not `read_to_end`)
- ✅ W3 widget controls — verified in committed code (titlebar in index.html, capabilities/default.json, height=186)
- ✅ W4 rebuild — complete; `npm run tauri build` succeeded (1m 04s, 2 bundles: MSI + NSIS)
- ✅ W5 E2E test RUN 2026-07-08 — transport verified byte-exact both directions of the matrix (.pdf→documents, .xyz→misc); W1/W2 confirmed in production
- ✅ L6.5 COMPLETE 2026-07-08 — status feed ported from `0c3a074` into the branch, reconciled with L1 (branch `config.py` kept), 24/24 tests pass, service restarted, `allocated` + `rejected` events live-verified in status.json → **W5 visual re-check is unblocked**
- ✅ Rejection semantics DECIDED — `rejected` = quarantine only; unmatched extensions = `allocated` with `dest: sorted/misc`. Red ✗ now means "quarantined" (today: oversized). W5's `.xyz → red ✗` expectation is re-scoped: `.xyz` → green ✓ with misc dest (see 04-50 coordination msg)
- ✅ Part 1 Linux (L1-L4) COMPLETE — gate is open; code was in e314607, ThinkPad verified live 2026-07-07
- ✅ L1/L2 live-tested on ThinkPad: 3GB sparse file → quarantined and STAYED (no loop); dotfile ignored; normal file allocated
- ✅ L3 verified: tailscaled enabled, Linger=yes, file-portal-allocator enabled+active; service restarted onto feat/library-pipeline code
- ✅ Part 2 Linux (L5-L6) COMPLETE — convert rule live-tested; `file-portal-converter` installed, enabled, e2e verified (allocator hop → "would convert" logged, dotfiles ignored)
- ✅ Docs consistency pass 2026-07-07: stale `inbox/quarantine` refs fixed (docs/05, receiver README), `linux-converter` added to root README/docs/00/docs/01, docs/10 checkboxes synced to reality, CHANGELOG updated
- ✅ W6 Convert tile DONE + E2E verified 2026-07-08 (`af904a2`) — green ✓ in ~4s, full Windows→allocator→converter chain confirmed. **W5 visual re-check PASSED** with it. Part 2 "Done when" = CLOSED both lanes.
- ✅ Part 3 Linux (L7-L10) COMPLETE 2026-07-10 — conversion engine live: probe → Clean/Scan lanes → atomic bundles to anchor+staging, all gates verified on the live service (see Session Log 2026-07-09/10). Open Decision #3 RESOLVED (probe/reroute/terminal-scan). Defect A (hardcoded WorkingDirectory) fixed both services; Defect B banner added.
- ✅ W7 "Force OCR → Vault" tile DONE + E2E verified 2026-07-10 (`1d15b16`) — 6th tile renders; drop → green ✓ with `dest: pipeline/convert-scan-inbox/…` in ~1s; ThinkPad converter forced the Scan lane on a digital PDF (probe 277 chars/page, `lane_reason: user_forced_scan`, re-OCR at 300 dpi, yield 279) and published the bundle to anchor+staging; source SHA-256 matched the local file byte-exact. Part 3 "Done when" = CLOSED both lanes.
- ✅ Part 4 groundwork 2026-07-10 — vault repo wired both ends, transport verified. L11 (exporter) and L12 (staging deletion) remain.
- ✅ Part 4 Linux (L11+L12) COMPLETE 2026-07-11 — exporter live in the converter service: staging bundle → vault commit → push → `cat-file -e` blob verification in the bare repo → staging deleted. Dedup no-op verified live; a 2×60s event-stall defect found at the live gate and fixed same session (export latency now ~25ms). **All Linux milestones (L1–L12) closed; the pipeline loop is code-complete.**
- ✅ Desktop vault consumption VERIFIED 2026-07-11 — `git pull` inside `<Vault>\Library` fast-forwarded `0272f89..ec1eaf6` over Tailscale SSH; history shows both L11 test ingests (`a49d49c`, `cfca152`) + the honest removal (`ec1eaf6`), tree back to seed files; no stray `.obsidian/` in Library and no Library entry in Obsidian's vault registry (Decision #4 gotcha clear). **The full pipeline loop is closed end to end: widget → allocator → converter → vault → Desktop.**
- ✅ First REAL document ingested 2026-07-12 ("Designing Freedom", Stafford Beer, 116 pp, 4.4 MB): converted (70s, Clean lane, 25 images), exported (`c624e00`), pulled + byte-verified on Desktop, filed to `Inbox/` (`0fa976c`). It took 4 attempts and surfaced **two defects** (see 2026-07-12 coordination messages):
  - **L13 (high): spaced filenames + images fail** — pymupdf4llm space-sanitizes the whole image path incl. directory components, but `main.py` builds the staging temp dir from the stem verbatim → first image write ENOENTs → quarantine. All milestone test files were space-free, so L1–L12 never caught it. Workaround until fixed: no spaces in dropped filenames.
  - **L14 (low): `INBOX_REL` off by one** — exporter commits to `Library/Inbox/` inside a repo whose root IS the vault's Library folder → vault shows `Library/Library/Inbox/`. Fix: `INBOX_REL = Path("Inbox")` + test expectations; no migration (Desktop filed the one bundle).
- ✅ L13 + L14 FIXED + live-verified 2026-07-12 (ThinkPad) — assembly dir now sha-keyed (`.part-<sha256[:16]>`, sanitizer- and length-proof; published bundles keep the original stem) + `bundle.clamp_name` 200-byte cap; `INBOX_REL = Path("Inbox")`. Regression test reproduces the exact field failure; 40/40 tests; one live drop (`L13 Live Gate - Spaced Name.pdf`) proved both fixes: CONVERTED (no quarantine) + EXPORTED to repo-root `Inbox/…` (commit `139f74d0`). **The spaces workaround is retired.** See `coordination/messages/2026-07-12T00-38--…l13-l14-fixed-live-verified.md`.
- ✅ L13 Desktop re-verification 2026-07-12 00:55 UTC with the **worst-case real name**: the original ~225-byte Anna's Archive filename (spaces + U+2019) CONVERTED in 70s, published name visibly clamped at 200 bytes (`…be8508ec`), and 12ms later `EXPORT-SKIP … dbcce92c already in vault` — the dedup no-op kept the vault clean. Retest anchor duplicate removed; all queues empty.
- ✅ **W8 "Add to Library" button DONE + E2E verified 2026-07-12 (`854d89f`)** — new `#vault-bar` in the widget (Claude Code-styled, ✳/terracotta) backed by `vault.rs`: glows "Add N new note(s) to Library" when the bare repo is ahead of the Desktop clone, one click pulls and names what arrived; 45s poll, 10s fast-poll for 3 min after any `pipeline/convert*` drop; new `vault_library_dir` config key (live config + `serde(default)`); window height 224; console window killed (`windows_subsystem`). Live gate: the Textor ingest (`fd0e50a`, 2nd real book, dropped by the user with its natural spaced name — L13 fix holding in the wild) lit the button in one poll; click pulled note+4 assets+manifest into `<Vault>\Library\Inbox\`. **Defect L15 found by that first click:** bundle-interior filenames (200-byte stems, ~230-byte asset names) exceed Windows' 260-char MAX_PATH — checkout failed until `core.longpaths=true` (now set in the clone AND passed `-c` by the widget). Filed to Linux lane: shorten interior names at the source (see 01-15 coordination msg).
- ✅ L15 FIXED + live-verified 2026-07-12 (ThinkPad, `d1112d2`) — bundle interiors are
  Windows-clean at the source: the engine converts from a short sanitizer-proof hardlink
  (`<slugify(stem)[:40]><ext>`, removed before publish) so asset names drop ~230 → ≤ ~61
  bytes, and `clamp_name` 200 → 80 bytes puts the worst-case note at exactly 160 bytes
  vault-relative. Also closes a latent ext4 overflow (>243-byte stems would quarantine at
  the asset write). Red-first regression test; 41/41; live gate: 230-byte spaced name →
  CONVERTED → EXPORTED `b914af1b`, committed paths measured 158/139/89 bytes by `ls-tree`.
  Desktop's `core.longpaths` mitigation may stay but is no longer needed for new bundles.
- ✅ **PR #1 (feat/library-pipeline → master) MERGED 2026-07-13 (`7c006f2`, merge commit, branch kept)** after repairing both first-contact CI failures same session: `CI / python` (pytest couldn't import the packages in the bare runner venv — `pythonpath = ["."]` added to both Python pyproject.tomls) and `CI / rust` (`cargo fmt` on post-July-5 widget code; clippy pre-cleared). All 6 checks green (python 14s, rust 3m14s, CodeQL ×3 + summary). Stale `fix/widget-blank-window` deleted on origin (all 5 commits patch-equivalent in feat, verified with `git cherry`). Known-red follow-ups: CI runs no `linux-converter`/`linux-dashboard` tests; checkout/setup-python actions emit Node 20 deprecation warnings.
- ✅ **GPU pipeline revamp scoped + Phase 0+1 executed 2026-07-18 (Desktop)** — scope committed as `docs/11-gpu-pipeline-revamp.md`; Phase 0 gate PASSED (uv + Python 3.12.13 + torch 2.11.0+cu128, 3080 visible); Phase 1 Marker-vs-pymupdf4llm A/B on the Beer book = **mixed pass** (Marker structurally better — paragraphs, sketches, 36 images, `_meta.json` TOC — but inherits `<sup>`/word-merge noise from the PDF's embedded 2013 OCR layer; `--force_ocr` at defaults thrashes the 10 GB card, killed at 27 min). Full numbers + fix candidates in docs/11.
- ✅ **Phases 1.5 + 2 CLOSED 2026-07-18 evening (Desktop, Session 14)** — Phase 1.5a: `--strip_existing_ocr --recognition_batch_size 32` **fixes the whole Phase-1 noise class** (0 `<sup>`, perfect TOC table, ~4 s/page, peak 7.9 GB); 1.5b: born-digital A/B (webpage-PDF, CJK) = Marker wins outright (27 s/19 pp, working hyperlinks, no icon spam); Phase 2 VRAM handoff **PASSED** (Ollama 0.32.1 + qwen3:8b, `keep_alive:0`: baseline 623 → 623 → 621 → 620 MiB across Marker→generate→Marker, 52.6 tok/s, no OOM). **Engine policy table + ⚠️ LLM link-rewriting hazard + factory/control-center design note recorded in docs/11.**
- ✅ **Phase 3 CLOSED 2026-07-19 (ThinkPad)** — sidecars measured and PASSED: specs recorded (i7-1265U 2P+8E/12t, 15.3 GiB RAM, 199 GB free, 4 GiB zram); Ollama 0.32.1 (user-level tarball, `~/ml/ollama` — no sudo in session; pacman package if role goes permanent) + phi4-mini q4: **~30 tok/s prompt eval, 4.1–5.8 tok/s generation, 3.06 GiB peak RSS** → async tagging gate PASS (10–60 s/doc), full-document analyst ruled out (~3 h/book); ChromaDB + MiniLM over the real vault (1218 chunks, 2 books): embed 34.2 s, queries 3–6 ms, all 4 relevance probes hit the right book → PASS. **Recommendation recorded in docs/11: product analyst stays on Desktop GPU (52.6 vs ~5 tok/s); ThinkPad carries tag/embed/structure.** Red flag #2 resolved.
- ✅ **Phase 4 slices 1+2 LANDED 2026-07-19 (Desktop, Session 15)** — `windows-converter/convert_and_ship.py` + `analyst.py`, design in `docs/12`. Slice 1 E2E with the **unchanged** ThinkPad exporter: agent-book bundle EXPORTED (`6008eb66`, blob-verified, byte-identical sha), re-ship → EXPORT-SKIP, and the **cross-machine dedup proof** — Beer converted fresh on the Desktop GPU (489 s full strip-OCR) skipped against the ThinkPad's 2026-07-12 ingest (`dbcce92c`). Slice 2: link-fenced qwen3:8b readability pass, 7/7 chunks fence-clean, 0 stray tokens, VRAM back to baseline. OCR-layer detection = text render mode 3 (font-name heuristic failed on the Beer layer — hit live). Windows gotcha: bsdtar mangles non-ASCII argv → tar sees only ASCII paths, remote `mv` applies the CJK name.
- ▶ Next up (user-gated): widget "Convert (GPU)" trigger + the control-room build-out (per-segment toggles, queue/ETA gauges, modern look); ThinkPad enrichment wiring (tagging/embeddings as a staging consumer). Phase 5 Forgejo: still deferred, maybe never. Carry-forward: `min_chars_per_page=100` provisional — revisit after ~30 real conversions; analyst E2E-to-vault leg awaits the next genuinely-new document (dedup skips analyzed re-ships of already-vaulted sources by design).

## Active Branch: `feat/library-pipeline`

Both machines work this branch. **Pull before every push.**
- Linux owns: `linux-receiver/`, `linux-converter/`, `config/`
- Windows owns: `windows-widget/`

No file conflicts if each machine stays in its lane.

## MACHINE: DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)

*Claude Code in `C:\Users\Rabbiallah\Projects\file-portal\windows-widget`*

### Part 1 — Windows Tasks (do these first)

- [x] **W1 — Make transfer atomic** (fixes file-corruption race)
  File: `src-tauri/src/transfer.rs`
  - Build `remote_tmp = "{remote_dir}/.part-{filename}"`
  - Set `remote_cmd = "mkdir -p {dir} && cat > {tmp} && mv -f {tmp} {final}"` (quote tmp and final via `remote_path_expr`)
  - Why: receiver currently sees `on_created` on a half-written file; atomic rename hits the safe `on_moved` path

- [x] **W2 — Stream, don't buffer** (prevents OOM on large files)
  Same file: `src-tauri/src/transfer.rs`
  - Replace `read_to_end` into a `Vec` with `std::io::copy(&mut local_file, &mut stdin)`

- [x] **W3 — Widget window controls** (independent quick win — no separate rebuild)
  - `src/index.html`: add `<div id="titlebar" data-tauri-drag-region>` containing a title span and `#min-btn` button (button has NO drag attribute)
  - `src/styles.css`: style `#titlebar` and `#min-btn` hover state
  - `src/main.js`: wire `#min-btn` to `getCurrentWindow().minimize()`
  - `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`: `core:window:allow-start-dragging` + `core:window:allow-minimize`
  - `tauri.conf.json`: window `height` bumped to 186

- [x] **W4 — Rebuild** after W1-W3:
  ```
  npm run tauri build
  ```

- [x] **W5 — E2E test** — RUN 2026-07-08 (user present, access approved). Result: **transport PASS, UI feedback BLOCKED**
  - .pdf → transferred byte-exact, ALLOCATED to `sorted/documents/` on ThinkPad (log 04:22:16 UTC) ✅
  - .xyz → transferred byte-exact, allocated to `sorted/misc/` (NOT rejected — branch code never emits "rejected" for unmatched extensions) ⚠️
  - Green ✓ / red ✗ never appeared: the status.json writer lives only on `master` (commit `0c3a074`), never merged into this branch → status.json stale since the 7/7 service restart. See `coordination/messages/2026-07-08T00-30--desktop-to-linux--w5-results-status-feed-regression.md`
  - **Re-run the visual check after Linux L6.5 lands**

### Part 2 — Windows Tasks (after Part 1 Linux is done)

- [x] **W6 — Add Convert tile** — DONE 2026-07-08 (commit `af904a2`), E2E verified
  - Added to live `%APPDATA%\file-portal\config.toml`, `config.rs` `AppConfig::default()`, and `portals.json`
  - Rebuilt (clippy clean, 2 bundles); 5th tile "To Vault" 🔁 renders (tiles are `flex: 1` — no window resize needed)
  - Drop test: .pdf → tile went GREEN "✓ w6-convert-test.pdf → pipeline/convert-inbox/..." in ~4s; allocator hop + converter "would convert" both logged on ThinkPad at 04:56:45 UTC
  - **This also closes the W5 visual re-check** — L6.5's status feed drove the green ✓ live. Part 2 "Done when" = fully closed.

### Part 3 — Windows Tasks (after Part 3 Linux is done)

- [x] **W7 — Add Convert-Scan tile** — DONE 2026-07-10 (commit `1d15b16`), E2E verified with
  force-OCR semantics per the 2026-07-09T23-05 coordination message: `category = "convert-scan"`,
  `label = "Force OCR → Vault"`, `icon = "🔍"` added to live `%APPDATA%\file-portal\config.toml`,
  `config.rs` `AppConfig::default()`, and `portals.json`; no `main.js` change. Drop test: digital

## MACHINE: ThinkPad C14 (Arch Linux)

*Claude Code in `~/Projects/file-portal` (or wherever the repo is cloned)*

### Part 1 — Linux Tasks ⚠️ GATE — must complete before anything else ⚠️

- [x] **L1 — Kill quarantine loop** (critical bug — stuck files keep re-processing)
  File: `linux-receiver/allocator/config.py`
  Change:
  ```python
  # OLD
  quarantine = root / "inbox" / "quarantine"
  # NEW
  quarantine = root / "quarantine"
  ```
  Update `Paths.from_root` and `ensure_exist` accordingly.
  Why: quarantining a file fires `on_moved` inside the watched tree, which re-handles it and un-quarantines it.

- [x] **L2 — Ignore temp/dotfiles in watcher**
  File: `linux-receiver/allocator/main.py`, inside `_handle` method
  Add at the very top:
  ```python
  if file_path.name.startswith("."):
      return
  ```

- [x] **L3 — Enable persistence**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable --now tailscaled
  sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
  ```
  Verify:
  ```bash
  systemctl is-enabled tailscaled                         # → enabled
  loginctl show-user "$USER" --property=Linger            # → Linger=yes
  systemctl --user is-enabled file-portal-allocator       # → enabled
  ```

- [x] **L4 — Put linger in installer**
  File: `scripts/linux/bootstrap-arch.sh`
  Add: `sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"`
  (NOT `install.sh` — that script refuses sudo)

**Done when Part 1:** 200MB+ file transfers without truncation; oversized file lands in `quarantine/` and stays; allocator + tailscaled survive a reboot with no login.

### Part 2 — Linux Tasks

- [x] **L5 — Route the convert category**
  File: `linux-receiver/config/rules.toml`
  ```toml
  [[rule]]
  category = "convert"
  match = ["*.pdf", "*.epub", "*.docx"]
  destination = "pipeline/convert-inbox"
  ```

- [x] **L6.5 — Port status feed from master `0c3a074` into the branch** — DONE 2026-07-08, live-verified
  (`allocated` + `rejected` events in status.json, 24/24 tests, service restarted).
  Results: `coordination/messages/2026-07-08T04-50--linux-to-desktop--l65-done-status-feed-live.md`

- [x] **L6 — Scaffold converter service**
  New: `linux-converter/` mirroring `linux-receiver/` structure
  Watches: `~/file-portal/pipeline/convert-inbox`
  At this stage: only LOG "would convert <path>" — no engine
  Enable: `systemctl --user enable --now file-portal-converter`

### Part 3 — Linux Tasks (HEAVY — dedicate a full session after reset)

- [x] **L7 — Install engines** — DONE 2026-07-09/10. `pymupdf4llm 1.28.0` into
  `linux-converter/.venv` (+`requirements.txt`) — NOT `--break-system-packages`; the service
  runs from its venv. `tesseract 5.5.2` + `tesseract-data-eng`; `pandoc 3.6` (Arch package is
  `pandoc-cli`). Import order `pymupdf.layout` → `pymupdf4llm` encoded in
  `converter/engines.py` (1.28 auto-satisfies it, kept as insurance).
- [x] **L8 — Dispatch by extension** — DONE 2026-07-10, live-verified: three `converter.log`
  lines at 00:41/01:02 UTC naming `engine=pymupdf4llm` (.pdf, .epub) and `engine=pandoc`
  (.docx). First-match dispatch mirrors `allocator/rules.py`.
- [x] **L9 — Two lanes + probe** — DONE 2026-07-10, live-verified: probe logged 1388.0
  chars/page (digital) vs 0.0 (scan); scan on Clean REROUTED to `convert-scan-inbox` with an
  `allocated` status event carrying `dest`; Scan lane OCR'd it (yield 929.0); terminal test:
  blank scan → exactly one REJECTED → `quarantine/`, scan-inbox empty after 75s, no loop.
  NOTE: in pymupdf4llm 1.28 the lanes are `SELECT_KEEP_OLD` vs `FORCE_DROP_OLD` — not
  `force_ocr=True`, which would KEEP a bad prior OCR layer (see CHANGELOG + coordination msg).
- [x] **L10 — Bundle output** — DONE 2026-07-10, live-verified: `tree` shows
  `<name>.md + assets/ + manifest.json` in both `library/anchor/` and `library/staging/`;
  the image link target resolved by `ls` (62,445-byte PNG); frontmatter stamped on both
  lanes' outputs; manifest carries source SHA-256 + engine/converter versions.

### Part 4 — Linux Tasks

- [x] **L11 — Exporter** — DONE 2026-07-11, live-verified. `converter/exporter.py`, a second
  watch inside the existing converter service (no third unit) + startup sweep. All Decision
  #4/#5/#6 constraints implemented: `Library/Inbox/<slug>--<sha256[:8]>/`, new-notes-only
  (pathspec-scoped, self-identifying `file-portal-converter` commits), identical-sha
  re-ingest = `EXPORT-SKIP` no-op (deduped via `git grep` over committed manifests in the
  **bare** repo, so Desktop-filed notes still count), assets nested. 8 unit tests on real
  temp git repos. Live: `EXPORTED … commit a49d49c4 pushed + blob-verified` at 21:22 UTC.
- [x] **L12 — Staging deletion** — DONE 2026-07-11, live-verified with L11: deletion fires
  only after the push succeeded AND `git cat-file -e` confirms the commit + every bundle
  file's blob in the bare repo. Git failure → `EXPORT-FAIL`, staging kept, sweep retries;
  committed-but-unpushed resumes at push (unit-tested). No tag/folder placement; no
  `[[link]]` minting.

---

## Cross-Machine Communication Protocol

### Method 1 — Git-based messages (current) ✅
Write a markdown file to `coordination/messages/`:
```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM--{from}-to-{to}--{subject}.md
```
Commit and push. The other agent pulls and reads. Already in use.

### Method 2 — Tailscale SSH shared file
```bash
# write to ThinkPad from Desktop
tailscale ssh user@thinkpad "cat > ~/file-portal/coordination/state.json" < state.json
# read from ThinkPad
tailscale ssh user@thinkpad "cat ~/file-portal/coordination/state.json"
```

### Method 3 — MCP server over Tailscale (real-time, optional)
**Setup (ThinkPad):**
```bash
pip install mcp --break-system-packages
# Run a lightweight HTTP MCP endpoint on port 8765, bind 0.0.0.0
```
**Desktop agent config:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thinkpad-coordination": {
      "url": "http://<thinkpad-tailscale-ip>:8765/mcp",
      "transport": "http"
    }
  }
}
```
Check ThinkPad Tailscale IP: `tailscale ip -4`

## Open Decisions

| # | Decision | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Disable Tailscale key expiry on always-on nodes | Yes |
| 2 | Convert tile only vs push-from-library-on-demand | Tile only |
| 3 | Clean-lane failure: bounce whole file vs convert-and-flag | **RESOLVED 2026-07-09: neither.** Pre-flight text-layer probe; auto-route to Scan on empty (normal `allocated` hop). Scan lane is terminal — OCR failure quarantines (`rejected`). All output frontmatter-stamped. Threshold (`min_chars_per_page`, seed 100) configurable. |
| 4 | Return transport method | **RESOLVED + VERIFIED 2026-07-10: bare repo + Tailscale SSH.** Bare repo `~/file-portal/vault.git` on the ThinkPad, HEAD pinned to `refs/heads/main` (deliberate; git default was master). Seed `71cc4c5` (`.gitattributes`: `* text=auto eol=lf`, png/pdf binary) landed **before any content**; `0272f89` adds `.gitignore` for `.obsidian/`. Converter commits in the non-bare working clone `~/file-portal/vault-work`, pushes over the local filesystem. Desktop clone at `<Vault>\Library` with `core.sshCommand="tailscale ssh"` persisted in its config; host `rab@archlinux`, the same pair the widget has used since W5. **Fetch and push both confirmed.** Vault root stays a plain folder — only `Library/` is a repo, so wiki-links resolve vault-wide while git scope stays confined to machine-produced bundles. Exactly one side initializes. Invariant: the converter creates new notes only, never edits existing ones. Assets-in-repo is deliberate and irreversible. Forgejo may later serve the same bare repo as a read-only browse surface, never the write path. **GOTCHA:** opening `Library/` in Obsidian creates a stray `.obsidian/` and registers it as a separate vault, breaking wiki-link resolution from the parent. `.gitignore` guards the artifact; the vault switcher must not list Library. |
| 5 | Graph links: dense/dirty vs sparse/earned | **RESOLVED 2026-07-10: sparse.** The converter transcodes, it does not read. Mint a link only where it encodes a fact the converter knows (`![[asset]]` embeds do; `[[concept]]` links do not). Two structural reasons: (a) minted and hand-earned links are indistinguishable in the graph after the fact, so minting destroys the graph's value as a record of what was noticed — not recoverable later; (b) wiki-links mutate the note body while frontmatter does not — frontmatter is losslessly strippable, prose is not. No extraction heuristic will be added. |
| 6 | Vault placement of converted bundles | **RESOLVED 2026-07-10: single inbox, no automatic tag/folder placement.** Bundles land at `Library/Inbox/<slug>--<sha256[:8]>/`. Lane facts stay in frontmatter, not in the path — the path is the irreversible axis and lane is an ingestion detail. Assets live inside the bundle folder (`assets/`), never a shared attachments dir, so relative links survive later filing. Re-ingesting an identical `source_sha256` is a no-op with a log line, not a duplicate bundle. "Delete staging after send" fires only after the commit exists AND `git cat-file -e` confirms the blob — never on write-success alone. Content tagging is a future, separate stage that reads the markdown (Ollama batch) — never the converter's job. |

## Session Log

### 2026-07-05 — Desktop agent Session 1 (Cowork/Dispatch)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**What was done:**
- Verified Tauri v2 build: 45s compile, 2 bundles (MSI + NSIS), no errors
- Widget launched (file-portal-widget.exe, 8.77 MB)
- Created `coordination/messages/` folder in repo
- Wrote and committed desktop build report to coordination/messages/
- Created this CLAUDE_README.md with full mission brief and session protocol
- Pushed all to `feat/library-pipeline`
**E2E test:** pending — needs user at desktop to approve File Portal access dialog

### 2026-07-05 — Desktop agent Session 2 (Cowork/Dispatch)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** Audit W1-W3 code in repo; update task list; close session cleanly.
**What was done:**
- Opened transfer.rs — W1 (atomic `.part-` + `mv -f`) and W2 (`std::io::copy`) ALREADY implemented and committed
- Opened capabilities/default.json — W3 permissions (`allow-start-dragging`, `allow-minimize`) ALREADY present
- Opened index.html — W3 titlebar + min-btn ALREADY in place
- Opened tauri.conf.json — height ALREADY 186
- Updated CLAUDE_README.md: marked W1/W2/W3 [x], updated Status Summary with verified findings
- Committed and pushed session protocol update + audit results
**Verification:** Opened each file directly in Notepad and confirmed code presence — not inferred from comments.
**Next for Desktop (W4):** Run `npm run tauri build` from a terminal — ensure compiled exe includes W1-W3 (last known build was 11:10 AM, uncertain if W1-W3 were present then)
**Next for ThinkPad (L1):** open `linux-receiver/allocator/config.py`, move quarantine out of inbox tree — GATE for all other work

### 2026-07-05 — Desktop agent Session 3 (Cowork/Dispatch)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** Execute W4 — run `npm run tauri build` from windows-widget/ directory.
**What was done:**
- User ran `npm run tauri build` from `C:\Users\Rabbiallah\Projects\file-portal\windows-widget`
- Rust compiled successfully in 1m 04s (release profile, optimized)
- Built: `src-tauri\target\release\file-portal-widget.exe`
- Bundled: `File Portal_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi` and `File Portal_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`
- Zero errors
- Marked W4 [x] in this file
**Next for Desktop (W5):** E2E test — run the widget, drop .pdf (expect green/allocated) and .xyz (expect red/rejected) on portal tiles
**Next for ThinkPad (L1):** open `linux-receiver/allocator/config.py`, move quarantine out of inbox tree — GATE for all other work

### 2026-07-07 — ThinkPad agent Session 1 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** ThinkPad C14 (Arch Linux), repo at `~/file-portal-src`
**Plan:** Start L1 per task list; discovered L1/L2/L4 code already committed (e314607, drafted from desktop, never verified on Linux). Pivoted to: deploy the branch to the live service, verify L1-L3 on real hardware, close the Part 1 gate.
**What was done:**
- Checked out `feat/library-pipeline` locally (clone was on master — the running service had the OLD buggy code in memory)
- Audited e314607: L1 (quarantine = root/"quarantine"), L2 (dotfile early-return in `_handle`), L4 (linger in bootstrap-arch.sh) all present in code
- Verified L3 system state: `tailscaled` enabled, `Linger=yes`, `file-portal-allocator` enabled + active — persistence was already configured
- Restarted `file-portal-allocator` so the running process picked up the branch code; it created `~/file-portal/quarantine/` at root
- **Live gate test (all passed):** 3GB sparse file → REJECTED to `~/file-portal/quarantine/` with a single log line and STAYED (no re-processing loop); `.part-dotfile-test` → silently ignored, no log entry; `normal-test.txt` → ALLOCATED to `sorted/documents/`
- Cleaned up test artifacts and removed stale empty `~/file-portal/inbox/quarantine/` dir
- Marked L1-L4 [x]; updated Status Summary
**Verification:** Functional, on live service — not code inspection. Log lines in `~/file-portal/logs/allocator.log` at 2026-07-07 02:39 UTC.
**Not yet done from "Done when":** 200MB+ real transfer from Windows (needs W5/user at desktop) and reboot-survival check (needs a reboot — config is correct: enabled + linger).
**Next for ThinkPad (L5/L6):** add `convert` rule to `rules.toml`; scaffold `linux-converter/` log-only watcher service
**Next for Desktop (W5):** unchanged — E2E test needs user present

### 2026-07-07 — ThinkPad agent Session 2 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** ThinkPad C14 (Arch Linux), repo at `~/file-portal-src`
**Plan:** L5 → L6, segment-wise verification, docs consistency pass.
**What was done (each segment verified before moving on):**
- *Segment L5 (convert rule):* already in `rules.toml` from desktop draft. Live-verified: `.pdf` on convert → `pipeline/convert-inbox/`; unmatched `.xyz` → `sorted/misc/`; no allocator restart needed (rules re-read per event). Log lines 02:48 UTC.
- *Segment L6 code:* `linux-converter/` scaffold already on branch. Read every file. `ruff check` passed; `ruff format` fixed one over-long line in `main.py`; **found + fixed: `scripts/install.sh` was mode 100644** (README says `./scripts/install.sh` — would have failed). chmod +x, committed as mode change.
- *Segment L6 deploy:* ran `./scripts/install.sh` (no sudo) — venv created, watchdog 4.0.2, unit installed. `is-active` + `is-enabled` both positive; "watching /home/rab/file-portal/pipeline/convert-inbox" logged 03:00 UTC.
- *Segment L6 e2e:* `.pdf` dropped on convert → allocator ALLOCATED and converter "would convert" logged in the same millisecond (03:00:47.782). `.part-*` dotfile in convert-inbox → correctly silent.
- *Docs consistency pass:* fixed stale `inbox/quarantine/` claims in `docs/05-allocation-rules.md` + `linux-receiver/README.md` (contradicted the L1 fix); added `linux-converter/` to root README table, `docs/00-overview.md` components, `docs/01-architecture.md` data flow (step 6: process-mouth destinations); synced `docs/10` Part 1+2 Linux checkboxes to reality; CHANGELOG: 2 Added + 2 Fixed entries. Left historical `inbox/quarantine` mentions in CHANGELOG/DOCS-AUDIT (they describe the past, correctly).
- Cleaned all test artifacts (convert-inbox, sorted/misc).
**Verification:** every claim above has a log line, systemctl output, or grep behind it — nothing inferred from code comments.
**Part 2 "Done when" status:** Linux half fully green. Remaining: W6 Convert tile on Desktop, then a real tile-drop confirms the full path.
**Next for Desktop (W5 + W6):** E2E test (user present) + add Convert tile (`config.toml`, `config.rs` default, `portals.json`)
**Next for ThinkPad (Part 3, L7-L10):** converter engine — heavy; dedicate a full session; remember `import pymupdf.layout` BEFORE `import pymupdf4llm`

### 2026-07-08 — Desktop agent Session 4 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** Execute W5 E2E test (user present to approve access dialog).
**What was done:**
- Pulled `6ffd910` (cleared a stale 3-day-old `.git/HEAD.lock` first — zero bytes, no git process running)
- Launched post-W4 widget build (exe dated 2026-07-05 23:19); computer-use access approved by user — W5's standing blocker cleared
- **W5a (.pdf → Documents tile):** drag-drop registered ("Sent 1 file(s) to documents."), file arrived byte-exact (246 B, `%PDF-1.4` header intact), ThinkPad allocator ALLOCATED to `sorted/documents/` at 04:22:16 UTC
- **W5b (.xyz → Documents tile):** transferred byte-exact (16 B), allocator allocated to `sorted/misc/` — NOT rejected
- **Green ✓ / red ✗ never appeared (waited >30s).** Widget status advanced to "Sent — allocator pending for 1 file(s)." and stalled there.
- **Root cause found (regression):** widget's `status.rs` polls `~/file-portal/logs/status.json`; the writer was implemented only on `master` (`0c3a074`, "add status feed and tests") and is NOT an ancestor of `feat/library-pipeline`. status.json's last event is 2026-07-07T02:37:28 — the moment the ThinkPad restarted the service onto branch code, events stopped.
- **Second gap:** branch allocator routes unmatched extensions to `sorted/misc/` and never emits "rejected" — the red-✗ path in `main.js` is unreachable regardless of the status feed.
- Filed both in `coordination/messages/2026-07-08T00-30--desktop-to-linux--w5-results-status-feed-regression.md`; added task **L6.5** (port status feed) to the ThinkPad list
- Cleaned all test artifacts (ThinkPad `sorted/`, local Desktop test folder)
**Verification:** allocator log lines, remote `stat` byte counts, `git merge-base --is-ancestor` check, widget screenshots at each stage.
**W5 verdict:** transport + allocation E2E = PASS (W1/W2 proven in production); visual feedback = BLOCKED on L6.5. Re-run the 30s visual check after L6.5 lands.
**Next for ThinkPad (L6.5):** port status feed from `0c3a074` into `linux-receiver/allocator/`, reconcile with branch L1/L2, restart service
**Next for Desktop:** W6 Convert tile; re-check W5 visuals once L6.5 is live

### 2026-07-08 — ThinkPad agent Session 3 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** ThinkPad C14 (Arch Linux), repo at `~/file-portal-src`
**Plan:** L6.5 — port status feed from master `0c3a074`; adopt recommended rejection semantics; deploy + live-verify.
**What was done (segment-wise, each verified before moving on):**
- *Audit:* diffed `0c3a074` against the branch. Master's `main.py` is a behavioral superset of the branch's L1/L2 re-implementation; the only genuine conflict is `config.py` quarantine location, where the branch's L1 fix (`root/quarantine`) wins.
- *Port:* copied `status.py`, both test files, and `requirements-dev.txt` verbatim from `0c3a074`; replaced `main.py` with the master version (single change: quarantine-guard comment reworded for the L1 layout — the guard itself stays as defense-in-depth); `rules.py` picked up master's formatting via `ruff format`. Branch `config.py` untouched.
- *Tests/lint:* installed requirements-dev.txt into the repo venv; **24/24 pytest pass**, `ruff check` + `ruff format` clean.
- *Deploy:* restarted `file-portal-allocator` (04:34 UTC, "watching" logged, active).
- *Live verify:* `l65-test.txt` → ALLOCATED 04:44:30 + fresh `allocated` event in status.json (first since the 07-07 02:37:28 stall). 3GB sparse file → REJECTED 04:44:43 + `rejected` event with reason; stayed in `quarantine/`, exactly one log line (no loop). `python -m json.tool` parses status.json cleanly. Artifacts removed.
- *Rejection semantics DECIDED* per Desktop's recommendation: `rejected` = quarantine only; unmatched → `allocated` with `dest: sorted/misc`. W5's `.xyz → red ✗` expectation is re-scoped (now green ✓ with misc dest).
- Wrote coordination reply `2026-07-08T04-50--linux-to-desktop--l65-done-status-feed-live.md`; CHANGELOG entry added; marked L6.5 [x].
**Verification:** every claim has a log line, systemctl output, pytest run, or json.tool parse behind it.
**Next for Desktop:** W5 visual re-check (expect green ✓ on .pdf within 30s; .xyz now legitimately ✓ with misc dest; red ✗ requires >2048MB) then W6 Convert tile.
**Next for ThinkPad:** Part 3 (L7-L10 converter engine) — dedicate a full session; `import pymupdf.layout` BEFORE `import pymupdf4llm`.

### 2026-07-08 — Desktop agent Session 5 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** W6 Convert tile → rebuild → E2E verify (doubling as the W5 visual re-check).
**What was done (each step verified):**
- Added `convert` / "To Vault" / 🔁 portal to live `%APPDATA%\file-portal\config.toml`, `config.rs` `AppConfig::default()`, and `portals.json` (commit `af904a2`)
- Checked layout first: tiles are `flex: 1` in a 480px window — 5 tiles fit, no resize needed
- `cargo clippy --release` clean; `npm run tauri build` → 2 bundles (stopped the running widget first so the linker could replace the exe)
- Relaunched widget: 5th tile renders (screenshot-verified)
- **E2E drop:** .pdf on To Vault → tile went GREEN with "✓ w6-convert-test.pdf → pipeline/convert-inbox/w6-convert-test.pdf" in ~4 seconds. ThinkPad logs confirm the full chain at 04:56:45 UTC: allocator ALLOCATED → converter "would convert" → `allocated` event in status.json (which is what drove the green tile)
- **W5 visual re-check: PASSED** — L6.5's status feed works end-to-end through the widget UI. Part 2 "Done when" closed on both lanes.
- Test artifacts cleaned (ThinkPad convert-inbox + local test folder); widget left running with the new build
**Verification:** widget screenshots (green tile + status line), allocator/converter log lines, status.json event, clippy/build output.
**Next for ThinkPad:** Part 3 (L7-L10 converter engine) — dedicate a full session; `import pymupdf.layout` BEFORE `import pymupdf4llm`.
**Next for Desktop:** W7 (Convert-Scan tile) — blocked until Part 3 Linux lands.

### 2026-07-09/10 — ThinkPad agent Session 4 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** ThinkPad C14 (Arch Linux), repo at `~/file-portal-src`
**Plan:** Part 3 (L7-L10 converter engine) + Defects A/B + Change Ledger protocol change, per the session brief. Open Decision #3 resolved by user amendment before work began: **neither** bounce nor flag — pre-flight text-layer probe, sub-threshold reroute to Scan as a normal `allocated` hop, terminal Scan lane → quarantine, frontmatter on every output.
**What was done (each gate verified on the live service before the next):**
- *L7:* `pymupdf4llm 1.28.0` into `linux-converter/.venv` (divergence: docs/10 said `--break-system-packages`, but the service runs from its venv); `tesseract 5.5.2` + `eng` listed by `tesseract --list-langs`; `pandoc 3.6` (divergence: Arch has no `pandoc` package — it's `pandoc-cli`). Venv one-liner printed `pymupdf4llm 1.28.0` with `pymupdf.layout` imported first. Divergence: 1.28 hard-depends on `pymupdf_layout` and sets `_use_layout=True` regardless of import order — ordering kept in `engines.py` as insurance.
- *Engine (L8-L10 code, `29ff68f` + fix `4f15c33`):* first-match dispatch mirroring `allocator/rules.py`; probe; reroute; terminal Scan; atomic bundle publish to `library/anchor` + `library/staging`; Obsidian embed rewrite; frontmatter + manifest with source SHA-256; `converter.toml` (`min_chars_per_page=100`, provisional) re-read per event; `convert-scan` rule in `rules.toml`. 26 unit tests; ruff clean. Unit tests caught one bug pre-deploy (staging temp path collided with the assembly temp dir).
- **Live-gate bug #1 (the reason the gates exist):** first L8 run produced allocator ALLOCATED lines but zero converter reaction. Event probe proved: a rename whose source is outside the watch (the allocator hop, inbox/→pipeline/) is an unpaired `IN_MOVED_TO` = watchdog `created` event — never `moved`, never `close_write`. The allocator's event model does not transfer to this topology (the old L6 scaffold only worked because it reacted to `created` unconditionally). Fixed: handler reacts to `created` + size-stability wait, `moved` (reroute), `closed` (in-place writes), deduped by source consumption + watchdog's single dispatch thread.
- *L8 gate:* `00:41:20 CONVERTING l10-digital-with-image.pdf engine=pymupdf4llm lane=clean`, `00:41:32 … l8-book.epub engine=pymupdf4llm`, `00:41:40 … l8-paper.docx engine=pandoc` — three extensions, correct engines, live service.
- **Live-gate finding #2:** the brief's L9 wc-c gate premise ("Scan yields text where Clean yields little or none") is obsolete in 1.28 — layout mode auto-OCRs need-based in EVERY lane (both lanes produced byte-identical 929-byte output on the scan fixture). Engine source (`make_ocr_decision`) shows the OCR modes only govern *prior OCR spans*, and `force_ocr=True` maps to `FORCE_KEEP_OLD` — it would KEEP a bad prior OCR layer. Scan lane now passes `use_ocr=OCRMode.FORCE_DROP_OLD` + `ocr_dpi=300` (discard prior OCR, redo, hard-fail without an engine); Clean is `SELECT_KEEP_OLD`. Coordination message updated: W7's honest meaning is "redo any embedded OCR properly".
- *L9 gates (final code, 01:02-01:03 UTC):* PROBE 1388.0 (digital, Clean) vs 0.0 (scan) both logged; scan on Clean → `REROUTED … -> pipeline/convert-scan-inbox/l9-scan.pdf (chars_per_page 0.0 < 100)` + `allocated` event with that `dest` in status.json; Scan lane OCR-YIELD 929.0 → CONVERTED. **Terminal test:** blank scan through `inbox/convert-scan` (also proves the new rule live through the allocator) → exactly one `REJECTED (ocr yield 0.0 …) -> quarantine/`, one `rejected` status event (`category: convert-scan`), scan-inbox empty after 75s — no re-entry, no loop.
- *L10 gate:* `tree` showed `<name>.md + assets/ + manifest.json` in anchor AND staging; the markdown's one image embed `![[assets/l10-digital-with-image.pdf-0001-02.png]]` resolved by `ls` (62,445 bytes); `head -12` on Clean output (`lane: clean`, `ocr: false`, `chars_per_page_detected: 1388.0`) and Scan output (`lane: scan`, `lane_reason: no_text_layer`, `ocr: true`, `ocr_dpi: 300`); manifest carries sha256 + `pymupdf4llm_version: 1.28.0`.
- *Defect A:* both units templated (`__WORKDIR__`/`__EXEC_PATH__`), both installers `sed` like the dashboard's; verified by fresh install run + `systemctl --user show -p WorkingDirectory` showing the substituted path, both services active (`da9063e`). *Defect B:* snapshot banner added.
- *Protocol:* header `Last updated` deleted; Change Ledger added below Status Summary, backfilled from five SHAs each verified `--is-ancestor` (corrected the brief's 6ffd910 row: session also touched CLAUDE_README, docs/00, docs/01); §4 gained the diff-accounting + append-after-close steps (`935304c`).
- *Cleanup:* all test bundles, quarantined blank, and inbox files removed; inboxes/library verified empty. §4 accounting run over `e302785..HEAD`: every source file has a CHANGELOG entry; docs/protocol files are in this session's ledger row.
**Verification:** every claim above has a log line with timestamp, systemctl/pytest/ruff stdout, a status.json event, or an event-probe transcript behind it — quoted in this entry or in the commit messages.
**Next for Desktop (W7 — UNBLOCKED):** `git pull`, read `coordination/messages/2026-07-09T23-05--linux-to-desktop--w7-semantics-force-scan.md`, then W6-style tile: `category = "convert-scan"`, `label = "Force OCR → Vault"`, `icon = "🔍"` in `config.toml` + `config.rs` default + `portals.json`; rebuild; drop a PDF on it → expect green ✓ with `dest: pipeline/convert-scan-inbox/…` then a converted bundle on the ThinkPad. No `main.js` change needed.
**Next for ThinkPad (Part 4, L11-L12):** return transport (recommended git/Forgejo — Open Decision #4) + place-by-tags + delete staging after send. Also carry forward: `min_chars_per_page=100` is provisional — revisit after ~30 real conversions (chars_per_page is logged on every one).

### 2026-07-10 — Desktop agent Session 6 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** W7 Force OCR tile per the 2026-07-09T23-05 coordination message → rebuild → E2E through the ThinkPad's Scan lane.
**What was done (each step verified):**
- Pulled `ce56ca7` (fast-forward); read the W7 semantics message before touching anything — tile is a force-OCR *override* (`FORCE_DROP_OLD` re-OCR at 300 dpi), not a "scans go here" category
- Added `convert-scan` / "Force OCR → Vault" / 🔍 portal to live `%APPDATA%\file-portal\config.toml`, `config.rs` `AppConfig::default()`, and `portals.json`; no `main.js` change (reroute/reject reuse existing `allocated`/`rejected` events). Commit `1d15b16` (+ CHANGELOG entry — also noted W6 never got one; W7's covers the tile pattern)
- `cargo clippy --release` clean; `npm run tauri build` → 2 bundles in 42s (widget was not running — no linker conflict); relaunched: 6 tiles render, zoom-verified label (tiles are `flex: 1`, no resize)
- **E2E drop (computer-use, user-granted):** digital-text .pdf (901 B, generated) onto Force OCR tile → "Sent 1 file(s) to convert-scan." → green ✓ "w7-force-ocr-test.pdf → pipeline/convert-scan-inbox/w7-force-ocr-test.pdf" within ~8s
- **ThinkPad chain (01:25:42-43 UTC):** allocator ALLOCATED `inbox/convert-scan/` → `pipeline/convert-scan-inbox/`; converter PROBE 277.0 chars/page (above threshold — a real text layer) yet lane stayed `scan` (the override working as designed), CONVERTING engine=pymupdf4llm, OCR-YIELD 279.0, CONVERTED → bundle in `library/anchor/` + `library/staging/` with `manifest.json`; frontmatter reads `lane: scan`, `lane_reason: user_forced_scan`, `ocr: true`, `ocr_dpi: 300`; OCR'd body text matches the source page
- **Byte-exactness:** manifest `source_sha256` `7b060b…` == local `Get-FileHash` output — W1/W2 transport re-proven on this path
- Cleaned: ThinkPad anchor+staging test bundles removed (inboxes already empty — consumed, no loop), local test folder deleted
- §4 accounting over `c718ed2..HEAD`: `config.rs`/`portals.json`/`CHANGELOG.md` covered by the CHANGELOG entry; `CLAUDE_README.md` is protocol, in this session's ledger row
**Verification:** widget screenshots (6 tiles, green ✓ status line), allocator/converter log lines with timestamps, status.json `allocated` event, frontmatter head, SHA-256 comparison.
**Part 3 "Done when": CLOSED both lanes.** Desktop has no open tasks.
**Next for ThinkPad (Part 4, L11-L12):** return transport (git/Forgejo per Open Decision #4) + place-by-tags + delete staging after send. Carry forward: `min_chars_per_page=100` provisional — revisit after ~30 real conversions.

### 2026-07-10 — ThinkPad agent Session 5 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** ThinkPad C14 (Arch Linux), repo at `~/file-portal-src`
**Plan:** Documentation-only, per user instruction: record the Part 4 vault wiring (done manually outside any session) and the resolutions of Open Decisions #4/#5/#6. No code; nothing under `linux-converter/` or `windows-widget/` touched.
**What was done:**
- *Read-only verification of the ThinkPad-side claims before recording them:* `~/file-portal/vault.git` is bare (`rev-parse --is-bare-repository` → true), HEAD pinned to `refs/heads/main` (`symbolic-ref`); `~/file-portal/vault-work` at `0272f89` on `main...origin/main` with origin = the local bare repo; seed `71cc4c5` ships `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`, `*.png`/`*.pdf` binary) before any content; `find ~ -maxdepth 3 -name .obsidian` → nothing, so the vault lives only on the Desktop and L11 remains a real task. Desktop-side facts (clone at `<Vault>\Library`, `core.sshCommand="tailscale ssh"` persisted, fetch+push proven) recorded as reported by the user, who wired and verified them manually.
- *Open Decisions:* row 4 → RESOLVED + VERIFIED (bare repo + Tailscale SSH, full wiring facts + the Obsidian stray-`.obsidian` gotcha); row 5 → RESOLVED sparse (converter transcodes, does not read; mint only links that encode facts the converter knows); new row 6 → vault placement (`Library/Inbox/<slug>--<sha256[:8]>/`, no tag/folder mapping, assets nested, identical-sha re-ingest is a no-op, staging deletion gated on `git cat-file -e`).
- *Status Summary:* "(as of …)" date removed from the heading (the Change Ledger owns that fact); Part 4 groundwork line added.
**Verification:** the git-command outputs quoted above; the diff of this file is the deliverable. §4 accounting: only `CLAUDE_README.md` changed — listed in this session's ledger row.
**Next for ThinkPad (L11 + L12, the last Linux milestones):** build the exporter per the now-binding specs in Open Decisions #4/#5/#6 — converter (or a separate export step) commits each staging bundle into `~/file-portal/vault-work` at `Library/Inbox/<slug>--<sha256[:8]>/`, pushes to the local bare repo, verifies the blob with `git cat-file -e`, THEN deletes the staging copy; creates new notes only, never edits existing ones; no tags, no minted links. Invariants to test live: identical-sha re-ingest no-op, no partial bundle ever visible in the vault repo.
**Next for Desktop:** none. When L11 lands, `git pull` inside `<Vault>\Library` (or wire Obsidian Git) is the only consumer step — do NOT open Library/ as its own vault (see row 4 gotcha).

### 2026-07-11 — ThinkPad agent Session 6 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** ThinkPad C14 (Arch Linux), repo at `~/file-portal-src`
**Plan:** L11 (exporter) + L12 (staging deletion) per the binding specs in Open Decisions #4/#5/#6.
**Housekeeping first:** Session 5's completed doc changes were found sitting UNCOMMITTED in the working tree (its close was never made — HEAD was still the open-plan commit). Committed them verbatim as that session's close (`7b4c286`, message notes the recovery) + its ledger row (`dde44f8`) before opening this session's plan (`80cc6ed`).
**What was done (each gate verified before the next):**
- *L11/L12 code:* `converter/exporter.py` — a second, non-recursive watch on `library/staging/` inside the existing converter service (no third systemd unit) plus a startup sweep for bundles that landed while the service was down; all git work serialized behind one lock. Flow per bundle: read `manifest.json` → `fetch` + `merge --ff-only origin/main` (commit on top of Desktop filing moves, never behind them) → dedup by `git grep -F <full source_sha256> main -- '*manifest.json'` **in the bare repo** (so a note the Desktop filed out of Inbox/ still counts, and a committed-but-unpushed clone can't fake a dedup hit) → copy via dot-prefixed temp + rename into `Library/Inbox/<slug>--<sha8>/` → pathspec-scoped `git add`/`commit` (self-identifying author `file-portal-converter`) → `push` → **L12 gate:** `git cat-file -e` on the commit AND every bundle file's blob, in the bare repo → only then `rmtree` the staging copy. Failure at any git step logs `EXPORT-FAIL` and keeps staging; committed-but-unpushed resumes at push (never re-commits); an uncommitted stray target from a crashed run is cleaned, a committed path is never overwritten. The exporter never initializes either repo (Decision #4: exactly one side does).
- *Tests:* `tests/test_exporter.py` — 8 tests against REAL temp git repos asserting on the bare repo's committed tree, covering: happy path, identical-sha no-op, dedup-after-Desktop-filed-it (`git mv` out of Inbox + push, then re-ingest → no new commit), git failure keeps staging, push-failure-then-resume (exactly one ingest commit total), incomplete bundle kept, sweep ignores dot-dirs. 34/34 suite-wide, ruff check+format clean.
- **Live-gate defect (the reason the gates exist, again):** first live drop converted instantly but exported 120s late (`CONVERTED` 21:20:45 → `EXPORTED` 21:22:45). Cause: the converter assembles TWO dot-prefixed temp dirs inside staging per bundle (`.part-<name>`, `.part-<name>.staging-copy`); each fired a `created` event whose stability wait held the single watchdog dispatch thread for the full 60s timeout — the dir gets renamed away, `rglob` on a missing dir yields `[]` forever, and the dot-check sat AFTER the wait. Fixed: dot-check before any waiting + the wait bails when the dir vanishes. Re-verified: `CONVERTED` 21:24:16.160 → `EXPORTED` 21:24:16.184 (~25ms).
- *Live gates (all on the running service):* fresh PDF → `EXPORTED l11-live-test-2 -> Library/Inbox/l11-live-test-2--141c0d4c (commit cfca1521 pushed + blob-verified, staging copy removed)`; byte-identical re-drop of the first PDF → converter re-converted (anchor got `l11-live-test (1)`) but exporter logged `EXPORT-SKIP … source_sha256 1dbf1aa1 already in vault — no-op, staging copy removed`, bare repo commit count unchanged; committed note's frontmatter `source_sha256` == `sha256sum` of the local source file; `vault-work` clean and in sync with origin; staging empty after every gate.
- *Cleanup:* anchor test bundles removed; vault test ingests removed via `git rm` + commit `chore: remove exporter live-test bundles` + push (history retains them honestly — the tree is back to seed files). Inboxes empty.
- *Docs:* CHANGELOG (Added: exporter; Fixed: event stall), linux-converter README rewritten (was still claiming "Part 2 skeleton (log-only)" — stale since Part 3), docs/10 Part 4 checkboxes + decisions table synced to reality (incl. the stale W7 checkbox), this file.
**Verification:** every claim above has a converter.log line with timestamp, a `git log`/`ls-tree`/`cat-file` output, or pytest/ruff stdout behind it. §4 accounting over `7b4c286..HEAD`: source files (`exporter.py`, `config.py`, `main.py`, `test_exporter.py`) covered by the CHANGELOG entry; CLAUDE_README/CHANGELOG/docs/10/linux-converter README are in this session's ledger row.
**Part 4 "Done when": Linux side CLOSED.** All Linux milestones L1–L12 complete; the pipeline loop is code-complete end to end.
**Next for user/Desktop:** `git pull` inside `<Vault>\Library` (or wire Obsidian Git) to consume ingested bundles — do NOT open Library/ as its own vault (Decision #4 gotcha). No open agent tasks on either machine. Carry-forward: `min_chars_per_page=100` provisional — revisit after ~30 real conversions.

### 2026-07-11 — Desktop agent Session 7 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** Consume the vault — the single Desktop step left after ThinkPad Session 6 closed L11/L12. (Small consumer step; work was done before this plan section was committed — recorded at close instead of as a separate open-plan commit.)
**What was done (each step verified):**
- Pulled `feat/library-pipeline` (`b615b0c..2ac2441`, fast-forward) and read Session 6's close before touching anything
- Located the vault clone: `C:\Users\Rabbiallah\Documents\Obsidian\Obsidian Vault\Library` — `core.sshCommand = tailscale ssh` persisted in its config, origin `rab@archlinux:file-portal/vault.git`, exactly as Decision #4 records
- **Decision #4 gotcha check (both halves):** no `.obsidian/` inside `Library/` (`Test-Path` → False) and no Library path among the five vaults in `%APPDATA%\obsidian\obsidian.json` — the vault switcher does not list Library
- Pre-pull state: clone at seed `0272f89`, working tree clean except a stat-only `.gitignore` phantom (`git diff` empty — the `eol=lf` normalization artifact this machine's clones are known for; no real delta)
- **Pull:** fast-forward `0272f89..ec1eaf6` over Tailscale SSH. History received: `a49d49c` + `cfca152` (the two L11 live-test ingests, SHAs matching Session 6's log exactly) + `ec1eaf6` (their honest removal). `git ls-tree -r HEAD` → `.gitattributes` + `.gitignore` only; on-disk dir matches (plus `.git`)
- No cleanup needed — the ThinkPad already removed all test artifacts; this session created none
**Verification:** git command outputs quoted above (pull transcript, ls-tree, config reads, registry read). §4 accounting over `2ac2441..HEAD`: only `CLAUDE_README.md` changed — protocol file, listed in this session's ledger row.
**The pipeline loop is now closed end to end and verified from both machines:** widget → allocator → converter → vault commit/push → Desktop pull.
**Next for both machines:** none open. Real usage begins; revisit `min_chars_per_page=100` after ~30 real conversions.

### 2026-07-12 — Desktop agent Session 8 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** First real document through the pipeline, user-requested: the Stafford Beer "Designing Freedom" PDF from Downloads (Anna's Archive copy, ~225-byte filename, 116 pages, 4.4 MB, sha256 `dbcce92c…fad`). Sent via the widget's own atomic transport (`.part-` + `mv` over `tailscale ssh` into `inbox/convert/`), which is also why the user's own earlier tile drop appears in the same logs. (Work ran ahead of the plan commit — recorded at close.)
**What was done (each step verified):**
- **Attempts 1–3 all quarantined on the identical failure:** first image write (page 43 = the book's first image) → `code=2: cannot open file '…/.part-Designing_Freedom_…/assets/….png'`. Attempt 1 was the user's own Force-OCR tile drop (23:52 UTC), attempt 2 my Clean-lane send of the verbatim name, attempt 3 a short-but-spaced name — which eliminated filename length and isolated spaces as the variable.
- **Root cause proven by two manual repros on the ThinkPad** (venv python, scratch dir, service untouched): (a) the identical file converts cleanly with a space-free assets path (116 pp, 24 images, 176 KB md); (b) `image_path="…/dir with space/assets"` fails with the error naming `dir_with_space` — **pymupdf4llm sanitizes spaces→underscores across the entire image path, directory components included**, while `main.py` builds `tmp_dir` from `file_path.stem` verbatim. Red herring documented: attempt 1's "filename too long" look was MuPDF's ~256-byte error-message truncation.
- Filed as coordination msg `2026-07-12T00-01--desktop-to-linux--converter-spaces-in-filename-defect.md` (commit `b65871d`) with repro + two fix shapes + "clamp length too" note. **No Linux code touched** (lane discipline; live service left as-is).
- **Attempt 4 (space-free `Designing-Freedom--Stafford-Beer.pdf`): full success.** CONVERTED in 70s (Clean lane, probe 1484.7), EXPORTED in 121ms (`c624e00` pushed + blob-verified, staging removed) — the Session 6 event-stall fix visibly holding.
- **Desktop consumption:** `git pull` in `<Vault>\Library` → 27 files. Byte-exactness: manifest `source_sha256` == frontmatter == local `Get-FileHash`, all `dbcce92c…fad`; 25 assets; md opens `# DESIGNING FREEDOM / Stafford Beer`.
- **Second defect found at pull:** bundle checked out at `<Vault>\Library\Library\Inbox\…` — `INBOX_REL = Path("Library")/"Inbox"` is vault-relative wording applied repo-relatively (repo root IS the Library folder; L11 tests encode the same misreading). Filed as `2026-07-12T00-20--desktop-to-linux--exporter-inbox-rel-double-library.md`. Desktop-side remedy applied as a normal Decision #6 filing move: `git mv` to repo-root `Inbox/` + push (`0fa976c`) — dedup unaffected (manifest travels; grep is repo-wide).
- *Cleanup:* 3 quarantined copies on the ThinkPad sha-verified identical to the local original, then removed; `~/tmp/df-debug/` repro dir removed; inboxes/staging empty. User's original stays in Downloads untouched.
**Verification:** converter.log lines with timestamps, two repro transcripts, git pull/push/log output, Get-FileHash vs manifest vs frontmatter, remote `sha256sum` before every delete. §4 accounting over `0f02b6c..HEAD`: only coordination messages + this file — no source changed; all listed in this session's ledger row.
**Defect tally for the first real document: 2 (one high, one cosmetic) — both found by real input within minutes of "code-complete", both with proven root causes.**
**Next for ThinkPad (L13 + L14):** fix per the two coordination messages; add a spaced-filename+image test; consider clamping `bundle_name` length.
**Next for Desktop/user:** drop real documents (space-free names until L13 lands); pull `<Vault>\Library` to consume.

### 2026-07-12 — ThinkPad agent Session 7 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** ThinkPad C14 (Arch Linux), repo at `~/file-portal-src`
**Plan:** L13 (spaced filenames + images) + L14 (`INBOX_REL` doubled level), per the Desktop's two 2026-07-12 coordination messages.
**What was done (each gate verified before the next):**
- *L14 (`be3a7fd`):* `INBOX_REL = Path("Inbox")` — Decision #6's `Library/Inbox/…` is vault-relative; the repo root IS the vault's Library folder (Decision #4), so repo-relative it is plain `Inbox/`. Module docstring corrected; `test_exporter.py` expectations fixed (they encoded the same misreading), incl. the Desktop-filing test which now moves to `Filed/` so it stays a genuine out-of-Inbox move. 8/8 exporter tests green. No migration, per the Desktop's analysis.
- *L13 (`1e1ea6d`):* the assembly temp dir the engine writes into is now keyed on the source sha — `.part-<sha256[:16]>` — instead of the verbatim stem (`sha256_of` moved above dir creation). Sanitizer-proof by construction (pymupdf4llm rewrites spaces→underscores across the whole image path, directory components included) and immune to filename-length pressure. The published bundle keeps the original stem: anchor/staging dirs and the `.md` note name are unchanged — only the engine-visible path changed. Added `bundle.clamp_name` (200 utf-8 bytes, codepoint-safe, trailing dot/space strip) applied to `bundle_name`, covering the Desktop's ~225-byte Anna's Archive near-miss: 200 + `.part-…staging-copy` (+19) + ` (n)` stays under ext4's 255-byte component limit.
- *Tests:* `test_spaced_filename_with_image_converts` — **run red first against pre-fix `main.py` (git stash), failing with the byte-for-byte field error** (`cannot open file '….part-Designing_Freedom_-_Stafford_Beer/assets/….png'`), green after; every `![[assets/…]]` embed in the output asserted to resolve on disk. Plus a 250-byte spaced-stem clamp test and 4 `clamp_name` unit tests. **40/40 suite-wide, ruff check+format clean.**
- *Deploy + live gate (one drop proved both fixes):* service restarted (both watches logged); `L13 Live Gate - Spaced Name.pdf` (spaced name, embedded image, sha `498ceb81…`) through `inbox/convert/` → 00:18:00 ALLOCATED → PROBE 118.0 → CONVERTED (anchor bundle under the original spaced name; embed `![[assets/L13_Live_Gate_-_Spaced_Name.pdf-0001-00.png]]` resolved by `ls`) → 00:18:01 `EXPORTED … -> Inbox/l13-live-gate-spaced-name--498ceb81 (commit 139f74d0 pushed + blob-verified, staging copy removed)` — repo-root `Inbox/`, no `Library/` prefix, confirmed by `ls-tree` on the bare repo (which also shows the Desktop's `0fa976c` filing at the same root).
- *Cleanup:* test bundle removed from anchor and `git rm`'d from the vault (`chore: remove L13/L14 live-gate test bundle`, pushed — history honest, tree back to seed + designing-freedom); staging/inboxes/quarantine verified empty.
- *Docs:* CHANGELOG (2 Fixed entries), coordination reply `2026-07-12T00-38--linux-to-desktop--l13-l14-fixed-live-verified.md`, this file.
**Verification:** every claim above has a pytest/ruff run, a converter/allocator log line with timestamp, or a `git ls-tree`/`log` output behind it. §4 accounting over `ef5a8e8..HEAD`: source files (`main.py`, `bundle.py`, `exporter.py`, 3 test files) covered by the two CHANGELOG entries; CLAUDE_README + coordination message are in this session's ledger row.
**The spaces workaround is retired — drop files with their natural names.**
**Next for Desktop/user:** `git pull` in `<Vault>\Library` when convenient (brings the test bundle's add+remove pair); then just real usage. No open agent tasks on either machine. Carry-forward: `min_chars_per_page=100` provisional — revisit after ~30 real conversions (the L13 live gate's dense single page probed 118.0 — real one-pagers can sit near the threshold).

### 2026-07-12 — Desktop agent Session 9 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** User-requested re-verification of L13/L14 with the worst-case real input: resend the original Anna's Archive filename (~225 bytes, spaces, U+2019 apostrophe) that produced Session 8's three quarantines. Expected outcome: CONVERTED (L13) then EXPORT-SKIP (content `dbcce92c…` already in vault — dedup, not a duplicate). (Short verification session; recorded at close.)
**What was done:**
- Pulled `4bcbef1..f490592` (ThinkPad Session 7 close) and read the 00:38 coordination reply before sending.
- Sent the verbatim original name via the atomic transport → 00:55:08 PROBE 1484.7 lane=clean → **00:56:18 CONVERTED (70s)** with the published name visibly clamped at 200 bytes (`…60cd4be69533ace7be8508ec`) → **00:56:18.375 `EXPORT-SKIP … source_sha256 dbcce92c already in vault — no-op, staging copy removed`** (12ms). Both fixes + dedup confirmed on the exact input that broke Session 8.
- *Cleanup:* retest's long-name anchor duplicate removed (anchor keeps the real `Designing-Freedom--Stafford-Beer` copy); staging/inboxes/quarantine verified empty; vault clone pulled `0fa976c..c8fbe28` (the live-gate add+remove pair) — tree = seed + designing-freedom at `Inbox/`, exactly as the ThinkPad predicted.
**Verification:** converter.log lines quoted above; remote `ls` of anchor/staging/inboxes/quarantine; `git log` + `Get-ChildItem` on the vault clone. §4 accounting over `f490592..HEAD`: only CLAUDE_README — this session's ledger row.
**Next for both machines:** none open. Real usage with natural filenames; carry-forward unchanged.

### 2026-07-12 — Desktop agent Session 10 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** W8 — user-requested "Add to Library" button in the widget: visual, Claude Code-styled, one click pulls new vault bundles into Obsidian. Plan committed `6e9f9c6` before work.
**What was done (each step verified):**
- *Backend:* new `src-tauri/src/vault.rs` — `vault_check` (fetch → `rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main` + new-bundle slugs from `--diff-filter=A` on `Inbox/*/manifest.json`) and `vault_pull` (fetch + `merge --ff-only`, then old..new diff for what arrived). Transport rides the clone's persisted `core.sshCommand="tailscale ssh"`; never initializes a repo (Decision #4). New `vault_library_dir` config key (`serde(default)` — pre-W8 configs parse; empty hides the feature); real path added to live `%APPDATA%` config.
- *Frontend:* `#vault-bar` between tiles and status — near-black panel, terracotta `#D97757`, monospace, ✳ glyph; states idle/ready(glow-pulse + slug preview)/working(spinning ✳)/success/offline. 45s poll; `applyStatusEvent` triggers a 10s fast-poll window for 3 min after any drop allocated to `pipeline/convert*`. Height 186 → 224. `cargo clippy --release` clean.
- *Live gate 1 (the reason the gates exist, third time running):* the user's own drop — the Textor book, natural ~230-byte spaced Anna's Archive name (L13 fix holding in the wild, `lane=scan`, exported `fd0e50a9` at 01:06) — lit the button "✳ Add 1 new note to Library" with slug preview on the first poll (screenshot-verified, computer-use granted). **Click FAILED usefully: defect L15.** `git merge` couldn't check out the bundle — interior filenames (200-byte clamped `.md`, ~230-byte asset PNGs) push full vault paths past Windows' 260-char MAX_PATH ("Filename too long"); my error mapping showed it as "vault host unreachable" (pull was one opaque step).
- *Fixes, same session:* every `vault.rs` git call now passes `-c core.longpaths=true` (+ set persistently in the clone); `vault_pull` split into fetch (fail ⇒ "offline") vs `merge --ff-only` (fail ⇒ "error" with git's real message); partial-checkout debris cleaned before retry. Also: `#![cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), windows_subsystem = "windows")]` added — the exe was console-subsystem and spawned a console window behind the widget.
- *Live gate 2 (post-fix):* button ready → click → pulled `c8fbe28..fd0e50a`, note (764 KB) + 4 assets + manifest on disk, `git status` clean, bar returned to "✳ Library · up to date" (screenshot + filesystem + `git log` verified). Final `npm run tauri build` (2 bundles) + relaunch: no console window, idle bar correct.
- *Filed L15* (`2026-07-12T01-15` coordination msg): bundle-interior names should be Windows-clean at the source (budget ≤ ~100 bytes; asset names re-derivable from the path handed to pymupdf4llm or renamed post-conversion with embeds rewritten). Desktop mitigation is live, so severity medium, no migration urgency.
**Verification:** clippy/build output, three widget screenshots (ready-glow with slug, post-fix pull, final idle), git log/status/ls in the clone, the failing merge transcript. §4 accounting over `6e9f9c6..HEAD`: widget source + tauri.conf covered by the CHANGELOG W8 entry; CHANGELOG/coordination/CLAUDE_README in this session's ledger row.
**The user's consume loop is now: drop → tile turns green → button glows within ~10s of export → one click → note in Obsidian.**
**Next for ThinkPad (L15, medium):** shorten bundle-interior filenames per the coordination message; regression test with a >200-byte stem asserting total path budget.
**Next for Desktop/user:** real usage. Widget left running with the final build.

### 2026-07-12 — Desktop agent Session 11 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** User-reported W8 regression: a black console window flashes and vanishes at random. (Small fix session; recorded at close.)
**What was done:**
- *Diagnosis:* W8's `windows_subsystem = "windows"` removed the exe's console — which every child process had been invisibly attaching to. Orphaned, each spawn (`git` in the 45s vault poll, `tailscale ssh` in status polls and transfers) opened its own console for the command's duration. The "random" timing = the 45s poll cadence plus event-driven status calls.
- *Fix (`vault.rs`, `status.rs`, `transfer.rs`):* `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (0x08000000) via `CommandExt::creation_flags` on all three spawn sites (const lives in `vault.rs`, shared). clippy clean.
- *Verify:* rebuilt, relaunched, screenshots at +8s and +53s bracketing a full poll cycle — no console anywhere, bar still reads "✳ Library · up to date" (proof the hidden fetch ran). Bundles regenerated so the MSI/NSIS installers carry the fix; widget left running on the final build.
**Verification:** clippy/build output, two timed screenshots, bar state. §4 accounting over `e360106..HEAD`: 3 source files covered by the CHANGELOG entry; CHANGELOG + this file in this session's ledger row.
**Next for both machines:** ThinkPad L15 (unchanged); Desktop real usage.

### 2026-07-12 — ThinkPad agent Session 8 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** ThinkPad C14 (Arch Linux), repo at `~/file-portal-src`
**Plan:** L15 (bundle-interior filenames vs Windows MAX_PATH), per the Desktop's 2026-07-12T01-15 coordination message. Plan committed `c73c130` before work.
**What was done (each gate verified before the next):**
- *L15, asset half (`d1112d2`):* the engine now converts from a short, sanitizer-proof hardlink (copy fallback) inside the sha-keyed assembly dir, named `<slugify(stem)[:40]><ext>`, deleted before publish. Chosen over the coordination message's rename-post-conversion shape because pymupdf4llm 1.28 (layout mode) derives asset names from `mydoc.name` — the full path it opened; the `filename=` kwarg is IGNORED for path-opened docs (`document_layout.py:1128`), so only the path handed to the engine controls the names. Asset basenames drop ~230 → ≤ ~61 bytes, and the link's extension means it can never collide with `assets/`. Bonus finding encoded in the code comment: a >243-byte source stem would have overflowed ext4's 255-byte limit at the asset write and quarantined L13-style on Linux — same fix closes it.
- *L15, note half (same commit):* `bundle.clamp_name` 200 → 80 bytes; worst case `Inbox/<slug60>--<sha8>/<stem80>.md` = exactly 160 bytes vault-relative, the lock-in number the coordination message proposed.
- *Tests:* new `test_interior_paths_fit_windows_budget` — 230-byte spaced stem + embedded image → converts, EVERY emitted file's vault-relative path ≤ 160 bytes, bundle root exactly `{note, manifest, assets/}`, every embed resolves — **run red-first against pre-fix code (git stash), both halves failing**; 200-byte expectations in test_bundle/test_main tightened to 80. 41/41, ruff check+format clean. (First test draft used a 260-byte stem — which cannot exist on ext4 at all; capped to 230, the real Anna's Archive shape.)
- *Deploy + live gate:* service restarted (both watches logged 05:47:11); 230-byte spaced-name PDF with embedded image through `inbox/convert/` → 05:47:30 ALLOCATED → PROBE 119.0 → CONVERTED (stem clamped to 80; asset `l15-live-gate-judgement-and-truth-in-ear.pdf-0001-00.png` = 56 bytes, embed resolved) → 05:47:31 EXPORTED (`b914af1b` pushed + blob-verified). `git ls-tree -r` on the bare repo measured the three committed paths at **158/139/89 bytes**. Test bundle removed from anchor and `git rm`'d from the vault (`0e079a8`, honest history); staging/inboxes verified empty.
- *Noticed while gating (user-facing, no code action):* (a) the 05:17 Textor re-drop hit the pre-L15 code, converted, correctly EXPORT-SKIPped, and left identical-sha `(1)`/`(2)` anchor duplicates — left in place, anchor copies of user drops are the user's call; (b) the 01:25 "Designing Brand Identity" quarantine is a genuinely bad file — an 80-byte "Link expired or invalid" error page saved as .pdf (failed download), so `unreadable by pymupdf → quarantine` is correct behavior; user should re-download.
- *Docs:* CHANGELOG (1 Fixed entry), coordination reply `2026-07-12T05-55--linux-to-desktop--l15-fixed-live-verified.md`, this file.
**Verification:** every claim has a pytest/ruff run, a timestamped allocator/converter log line, an `ls`/`xxd` inspection, or `git ls-tree` byte counts behind it. §4 accounting over `94db496..HEAD`: source files (`bundle.py`, `main.py`, 2 test files) covered by the CHANGELOG L15 entry; CLAUDE_README, CHANGELOG, coordination message in this session's ledger row.
**Interior names are Windows-clean at the source; the Desktop's `core.longpaths` mitigation is now belt-and-braces only.**
**Next for Desktop/user:** real usage; re-download the Brand Identity book (the quarantined copy is an expired-link error page); optionally tidy the two duplicate Textor anchor copies. Carry-forward: `min_chars_per_page=100` provisional — revisit after ~30 real conversions.

### 2026-07-13 — Desktop agent Session 12 (Claude Code / Fable)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** Repair both CI failures blocking PR #1 (feat → master), merge it with a merge commit, delete the stale fix branch. Plan committed `b3c3baa` before work. Context: master had been merged into feat earlier tonight (`2a1778f`, ThinkPad-side, 9 conflicts ours-side, 65/65 tests — no ledger row of its own; its master-carried files are accounted here), which put the July-5 workflow in contact with the branch's code for the first time.
**What was done (each step verified):**
- *CI / python (`665097b`):* reproduced CI's exact failure locally — fresh venv with ONLY `requirements-dev.txt` (CI's install), `pytest tests/` from `linux-receiver/` → the identical `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'allocator'` collection death. Root cause: the runner never installs the package and bare `pytest` doesn't put the package root on `sys.path` (local venvs/`python -m pytest` mask it). Fix: `[tool.pytest.ini_options] pythonpath = ["."]` in `linux-receiver/pyproject.toml` AND `linux-converter/pyproject.toml` (same latent bug; converter tests aren't in CI yet). Re-run in the same bare venv: 24 collected, 23 pass — the 1 failure is Windows-only (`sorted\documents` vs `sorted/documents` path-separator assertion), and CI's Ubuntu run confirmed: **python job green in 14s**.
- *CI / rust (`6aaa042`):* `gh run view --log-failed` showed pure `cargo fmt --check` diffs (no clippy/logic reached). `cargo fmt` reformatted `config.rs`/`main.rs`/`status.rs`/`vault.rs` — all code written after the July-5 formatting pass; zero behavior change. `cargo fmt --check` exit 0; `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` run locally to pre-clear the never-reached next CI step: clean.
- *CI green:* `gh pr checks 1 --watch` → all 6 checks pass (python 14s, rust 3m14s, CodeQL javascript/python/rust + summary).
- *Merge:* `gh pr merge 1 --merge` (no squash/rebase, no branch delete) → **MERGED 23:20:02 UTC, merge commit `7c006f2`** — verified two parents (`6630792` old master + `6aaa042` feat tip) and `feat/library-pipeline` still on origin.
- *Branch cleanup:* before deleting, checked `fix/widget-blank-window` (`b949b2a`) was NOT an ancestor of feat/master — but `git cherry` showed all 5 of its commits patch-equivalent to commits already in feat, so nothing orphaned. `git push origin --delete fix/widget-blank-window`; `ls-remote` confirms gone. Local copy left untouched.
- *Docs:* CHANGELOG (1 Fixed entry covering both CI fixes + known-red follow-ups), this file.
**Verification:** the before/after pytest transcripts in the CI-sim venv, fmt/clippy exit codes, `gh pr checks` final table, `git log origin/master -1 --format="%h %p %s"`, `git cherry` output, `ls-remote` empty result. §4 accounting over `d53c152..HEAD`: `2a1778f` merge-carried files (ci.yml, coordination README + 07-05 brief, docs/08, linux-dashboard/*, linux-converter test/bundle changes) belong to master's history and the merge commit's message; this session's source changes (2 pyproject.tomls, 4 widget .rs files) are covered by the CHANGELOG entry; CLAUDE_README + CHANGELOG in this session's ledger row.
**master now contains the full library pipeline; CI is green on contact.**
**Next for ThinkPad:** none open. **Next for Desktop/user:** real usage (unchanged carry-forwards: re-download Brand Identity, tidy Textor anchor dupes, `min_chars_per_page` review). CI follow-ups when convenient: add converter/dashboard tests to the python job; bump `actions/checkout` and `setup-python` majors to silence Node 20 deprecation warnings.

### 2026-07-18 — Desktop agent Session 13 (Claude Code / Fable) — GPU revamp scope + Phase 0+1
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows, post-reset)
**Plan:** Commit the GPU pipeline revamp scope (from the same-day planning session) as docs/11, then run Phase 0 (Desktop ML baseline) + Phase 1 (Marker vertical slice vs pymupdf4llm ground truth) in one sitting. Plan committed `f531451` before work.
**What was done (each step verified):**
- *Scope doc (`5e8b945`):* `docs/11-gpu-pipeline-revamp.md` — verified hardware table, VRAM math, both red flags (Forgejo not-on-Windows; ThinkPad unbenchmarked), the intake-flow inversion and its bundle-format-compatibility constraint, pre-answered decisions, Phases 0–5 with gates.
- *Phase 0 (no repo changes):* `uv` 0.11.29 via winget; CPython 3.12.13; torch **2.11.0+cu128** in `C:\Users\Bndit\ml\marker-env`. Gate verified: `torch.cuda.is_available() → True`, device `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080`. (One benign uv quirk: "Missing expected target directory for Python minor version link" — the interpreter installs and works anyway.)
- *Baseline:* `C:\Users\Bndit\ml\pymu-env` with pymupdf4llm **1.28.0 — the exact ThinkPad pin** — driven by a script replicating `engines.run_pymupdf` Clean-lane flags verbatim (incl. the load-bearing `pymupdf.layout` import order). Probe reproduced the recorded first-ingest value **to the decimal** (1484.7 chars/page) → faithful ground truth. 74.8 s, 24 images.
- *Phase 1 Marker run:* marker-pdf **1.10.2** (surya 0.17.1), default mode, warm conversion **97.3 s**, peak VRAM **8 675 MiB** (desktop baseline 1 156). Structurally better across the board (real paragraphs; 1 vs 30 bogus blockquotes; 36 vs 24 images; relative image paths; clean sketch captions where pymu emitted OCR-gibberish "picture text"; `_meta.json` structural TOC). Defect class inherited from the PDF's embedded 2013 Archive.org OCR layer: **319** `<sup>` artifacts, scrambled TOC table, word merges.
- *`--force_ocr` probe:* saturated the GPU 27+ min with no output at **9 939 MiB** peak (batch auto-scaling thrashes the 10 GB ceiling on a full-book 1 281-region re-OCR) — killed deliberately. Ruled out at defaults; not a hardware fault.
- *Verdict recorded in docs/11:* **Phase 1 = mixed pass.** Fix candidates ranked (all flags verified against `marker_single --help`): `--strip_existing_ocr` + capped `--recognition_batch_size` on a `--page_range` subset first; general batch caps to hit the ≤6 GB coexistence budget; deterministic `<sup>`/hyphenation post-pass in the bundle normalizer; born-digital PDF A/B as the missing evidence half.
**Verification:** torch gate output; probe-value match vs the 2026-07-12 ingest record; artifact counts measured on both outputs (`<sup>`, blockquote lines, image counts); nvidia-smi 2 s-interval VRAM logs (peaks extracted, logs deleted after); side-by-side reads of front matter + the Ashby's Law sketch pages. §4 accounting over `ab69064..HEAD`: CLAUDE_README + docs/11 only — doc/protocol files, in this row; no source changes, no CHANGELOG entry needed. Test artifacts kept at `C:\Users\Bndit\ml\phase1\` for the user's own inspection.
**Boundaries honored (user-set):** no Phase 2 (Ollama), nothing ThinkPad-side.
**Next for Desktop:** Phase 1.5 retests (strip-existing-ocr timed subset; born-digital book), then Phase 2 with the user present. **Next for ThinkPad:** nothing new — waits on the user's go.

### 2026-07-18 — Desktop agent Session 14 (Claude Code / Fable) — Phases 1.5 + 2 CLOSED
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** User green-lit the Phase 1.5 retests then Phase 2, and delivered the factory/control-center vision (widget = command center, allocator = conveyor, Marker = processing plant, Ollama = product analyst, vault = shipping) with instruction to capture it as design only. Plan committed `c2ac5a9` before work.
**What was done (each step verified):**
- *Phase 1.5a (`--strip_existing_ocr --recognition_batch_size 32`, Beer pp 0–15):* 63.3 s conversion (~4 s/page → ~8 min/116 pp), peak 7 887 MiB. Quality: **0** `<sup>` (was 319), **0** fake blockquotes, TOC table renders perfectly, word merges gone, italics recovered, complete ISBNs both prior engines mangled. **The Phase-1 noise class is fully fixed** — this is the Scan-lane config for PDFs with untrusted OCR layers. Output: `ml\phase1\marker-strip16`.
- *Phase 1.5b (born-digital A/B):* found a real candidate in Downloads — Chromium/Skia webpage-print PDF (AI Agent book GitHub page, 19 pp, mixed CJK/English, probe 1407.7). Marker default: 27.3 s, zero artifacts, working hyperlinks (pymu emits none), clean tables, CJK+emoji intact, 4 meaningful images vs pymu's 27 icon-spam assets, correct reading order (pymu interleaves the page sidebar). **Marker wins outright on born-digital.** Outputs: `ml\phase1\marker-agentbook` vs `pymu-agentbook`.
- *Engine policy recorded in docs/11:* born-digital → default (~1.5 s/pp); scan-with-OCR-layer → strip+batch-cap (~4 s/pp); raw scan → default. Router idea: existing `probe_chars_per_page` + pymupdf OCR-font-span check.
- *Phase 2 (Ollama VRAM handoff):* Ollama 0.32.1 (winget) + qwen3:8b (5.2 GB). Scripted Marker → `keep_alive:0` generate → Marker (`ml\phase1\phase2_handoff.ps1`): VRAM 623 → 623 → 621 → 620 MiB across all checkpoints, `ollama ps` empty immediately post-generate, sequence peak 6 187 MiB serialized, **52.6 tok/s**, no OOM. **Gate PASSED.**
- *⚠️ Product-analyst hazard found:* raw reformat prompt → qwen3:8b **invented image URLs** (`_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg` → `https://example.com/…`). Recorded in docs/11: the LLM pass must be link-fenced (strip/re-inject or in==out link validation). Never let the analyst touch packaging.
- *Design note (no implementation):* factory/control-center vision captured in docs/11 — station↔component map, two load-bearing principles (per-segment on/off + eval; logistics/ETA reporting from measured s/page + a converter status feed in the spirit of the allocator's `status.json`).
- *Two PS 5.1 gotchas recorded* (matter for any future Windows service wrapper): native stderr under redirection becomes fake failures (use `cmd /c`); `Invoke-RestMethod` mangles non-ASCII JSON (use UTF-8 file + `curl.exe --data-binary`). Both hit live, both fixed in the handoff script.
**Verification:** wall/VRAM from 2 s-interval pollers (logs deleted after extraction); artifact counts measured on every output; `ollama ps` checked at the unload boundary; all marker exits 0. §4 accounting over `c2ac5a9..HEAD`: CLAUDE_README + docs/11 only — doc/protocol files in this row; no source changes, no CHANGELOG entry needed.
**Boundaries honored (user-set):** no widget implementation, no Phase 4 rewiring, nothing ThinkPad-side.
**Next for Desktop:** control-room build-out is now unblocked design-wise — Phase 4 wiring (engine policy + link-fenced analyst stage, bundle-format compatible) and the widget factory-view, both user-gated. **Next for ThinkPad:** Phase 3 sidecars when online + user go.

### 2026-07-19 — ThinkPad agent Session 9 (Claude Code / Fable) — Phase 3 sidecars CLOSED
**Machine:** ThinkPad C14 (Arch Linux), repo at `~/file-portal-src`
**Plan:** Phase 3 per the user brief: spec check → Ollama + phi4-mini CPU tagging benchmark → ChromaDB + MiniLM over the real vault → Phase 3 results section in docs/11. Plan committed `8e755b3` before work. Boundaries: no live-service/exporter changes, no Phase 4, no Forgejo; benchmark envs outside the repo.
**What was done (each step verified from raw output):**
- *Spec check (the plan was blind on this):* i7-1265U (12th gen, 2 P + 8 E cores, 12 threads, 4.8 GHz max), 15.3 GiB RAM (~13.5 available at idle), 233 GB NVMe with 199 GB free, 4 GiB zstd zram swap active (0B used throughout all benchmarks). All from `lscpu`/`free`/`df`/`zramctl` directly.
- *Divergence noted per protocol:* the brief said native Arch `ollama` package, but no sudo credential was available in the session (`sudo -n` refused; autonomous run, nobody to type a password). Installed the official **v0.32.1 release tarball user-level** instead — same version as the Desktop's Phase 2 — extracted to `~/ml/ollama`, run as `OLLAMA_MODELS=~/ml/ollama/models ./bin/ollama serve` (no systemd unit, nothing system-level, fully removable; process stopped at session close). `sudo pacman -S ollama` supersedes it if the role goes permanent. (First download 404'd — release assets are now `.tar.zst`, not `.tgz`; second pull attempt needed after a registry HEAD timeout.)
- *phi4-mini benchmark (q4, 2.5 GB — the registry tag exists, no substitution needed):* real Beer-book body text → YAML frontmatter (tags/summary/reading_level) prompt; timings from the API's own `*_duration` fields, RAM from the runner's `VmHWM`. **Load 3.5 s cold / 0.3 s warm; prompt eval ~29–31 tok/s (consistent across 422- and 1330-token inputs); generation 4.1–5.8 tok/s; peak runner RSS 3.06 GiB.** Wall per tagging call: 9–56 s depending on excerpt size. **Async-tagging gate: PASS** (10–60 s/doc; generous multi-chunk stays under ~5 min). Same numbers rule the full-document product-analyst role OUT here: ~45 K-token book ≈ 3 h vs minutes on the 3080. Quality note recorded: on a bare 1500-char excerpt phi4-mini tagged Beer's wave *metaphor* as `physics`/`oceanography`; the 6000-char run recovered the real topics — tagging prompts need document context (title/TOC/multiple chunks).
- *ChromaDB + all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384d):* `uv` 0.11.29 (user-level install — machine had none) venv at `~/ml/chroma-env` (CPU torch); vault cloned read-only to `~/ml/vault` (2 real books; exporter's `vault-work` untouched). 1218 × ~800-char chunks: **model load 4.6 s, embed 34.2 s (35.6 chunks/s), Chroma add 0.8 s, queries 3–6 ms, peak RSS 1.16 GiB.** All 4 relevance probes hit the correct book with on-point passages (best: "Frege's account of judgement and assertion" → the Textor Frege chapter at distance 0.209). **Embedding gate: PASS with margin.**
- *docs/11:* Phase 3 results section written (Phase 1.5/2 style — spec table, both benchmarks, gate verdicts), Phase 3 checkbox ticked, red flag #2 marked RESOLVED, **recommendation recorded: product analyst on Desktop GPU (52.6 vs ~5 tok/s, mutex per Phase 2); ThinkPad carries tag/embed/structure sidecars.**
- *Hygiene:* `ollama serve` stopped; live allocator/converter services never touched (verified nothing under `systemctl --user` changed — no installs, no restarts); everything installed lives under `~/ml/` + `~/.local/bin/uv`, outside the repo.
**Verification:** every number above is from captured command output (lscpu/free/df/zramctl transcripts, Ollama API response JSON, `/proc/<pid>/status` VmHWM, timed index run with printed query results). §4 accounting over `a561cb7..HEAD`: only CLAUDE_README.md + docs/11 changed — doc/protocol files, listed in this session's ledger row; no source changes, no CHANGELOG entry needed.
**Boundaries honored (user-set):** no live-service/exporter changes, no Phase 4 rewiring, no Forgejo; benchmark envs outside the repo.
**Next for Desktop:** Phase 4 rewiring is now fully unblocked evidence-wise — engine policy (docs/11 table) + link-fenced analyst on the Desktop GPU, enrichment handoff to the ThinkPad sidecars proven here; all user-gated. **Next for ThinkPad:** none open — sidecar implementation arrives with Phase 4 wiring. If the enrichment role goes permanent: replace the tarball Ollama with the pacman package + a user-level service unit.

### 2026-07-19 — Desktop agent Session 15 (Claude Code / Fable) — Phase 4 slices 1+2 LANDED
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** User green-lit Phase 4 (the intake inversion). Design before code, then the vertical slice, analyst only if slice 1 closes cleanly. Plan committed `0a6e99b`. (User-supplied kickstart referenced the dead pre-reset `C:\Users\Rabbiallah\…` path — corrected to `C:\Users\Bndit\…` and verified the ThinkPad S9 Phase 3 claims against the pushed branch before building on them.)
**What was done (each step verified):**
- *Design (`27813dd`):* `docs/12-phase4-rewiring.md` — the bundle/exporter contract extracted from the real code (bundle.py/exporter.py/transfer.rs, cited by behavior), tar-over-`tailscale ssh` transport with dot-dir + atomic `mv` (scp/rsync unusable — managed host keys), mechanical engine routing, link-fenced analyst design, slice gates.
- *Slice 1 (`72b2532`, hygiene `88b10da`):* `windows-converter/convert_and_ship.py` — probe (pymupdf) → route → `marker_single` → format-identical bundle (80-byte clamp, `conversion:` frontmatter, `![[assets/…]]` embeds, manifest with full source sha) → local anchor (`C:\Users\Bndit\ml\library\anchor`) → ship. **Two live defects found and fixed during bring-up:** (1) OCR-layer detection by font name fails on the Beer layer — plain "Courier" — the robust signal is **text render mode 3** (`get_texttrace`), majority-of-spans rule, verified against both test PDFs; (2) **Windows bsdtar mangles non-ASCII argv** (CJK dir name arrived empty) — tar now only ever sees ASCII paths (bundle stays in `.part-<sha16>` locally; the remote `mv` applies the visible name — tailscale ssh carries Unicode argv correctly).
- *Slice 1 gates, all three PASSED with the **unchanged** ThinkPad exporter:* (1) agent-book PDF (born-digital, CJK name, 19 pp, 2.0 s/page) → **EXPORTED** `Inbox/bojieli-ai-agent-book-ai-agent--21bfdffc` (commit `6008eb66` pushed + blob-verified); independent `Get-FileHash` of the source == the vault-committed manifest sha, byte-identical. (2) Re-ship → **EXPORT-SKIP**, staging empty, no duplicate. (3) **Cross-machine dedup:** Beer converted fresh on the Desktop (full 116-pp strip-OCR run, 489 s = 4.2 s/page, exactly the docs/11 prediction) → **EXPORT-SKIP against `dbcce92c`**, the ThinkPad's 2026-07-12 ingest — the pipeline provably does not know or care which machine converted.
- *Slice 2 (`45e5995`):* `windows-converter/analyst.py` — the link-fenced qwen3:8b readability pass (docs/12 design): every embed → opaque `⟦IMG-n⟧` token pre-prompt, re-injected post; per-chunk token-multiset validation, violation ⇒ that chunk ships un-analyzed. Live test on the agent book: **7/7 chunks passed, 0 rejected, 206.5 s**, 4 embeds in == 4 out, 0 stray tokens, `analyst:` frontmatter stamped, VRAM back to baseline (659 MiB) after 7 `keep_alive:0` round-trips. Analyst-to-vault E2E leg deliberately deferred to the next genuinely-new document (dedup skips re-ships of already-vaulted sources — correct behavior, not a gap).
- *Interruption note:* a **power outage** killed the first Beer conversion mid-run (~22:40 local). Recovery was clean: all durable state (vault commits, pushed repo work) survived; one temp dir swept; the uncommitted slice code was intact on disk and committed before the rerun. Lesson applied: commit code before long verification runs.
**Verification:** all gate evidence is captured command output (converter.log lines, bare-repo `git log`/`git show`, `Get-FileHash`, staging `ls | wc -l`, nvidia-smi checkpoints). §4 accounting over `6547f52..HEAD`: `windows-converter/*` covered by the two feat commits + this row; CLAUDE_README/docs/11/docs/12/.gitignore are doc/protocol files in this row. CHANGELOG entry: pending next session alongside widget work (new component is additive, not yet wired to the widget).
**Boundaries honored:** zero `linux-receiver`/`linux-converter` edits (the whole point — the exporter consumed foreign bundles as-is); no widget changes; no Forgejo; ML envs + anchor outside the repo.
**Next for Desktop:** widget "Convert (GPU)" tile → watched folder → `convert_and_ship.py` (the conveyor rewire proper), control-room gauges per docs/11 design note. **Next for ThinkPad:** enrichment consumer (tagging/embeddings) fed from staging arrivals — needs a coordination message when Desktop wiring lands.

### 2026-07-19 — Desktop agent Session 16 (Claude Code / Fable) — Gemini analyst backend + pre-flight estimator
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows)
**Plan:** Gemini entitlement check → `--backend` flag → estimator → live fence test. Plan committed `ee1baeb`. Pre-session: rclone Drive remote established (user OAuth) and the **first headless anchor-mirror ran** — both Desktop-converted bundles to `gdrive:Claude Code Memory Backup/anchor-mirror/` (44 files); vault zip verified on Drive (4th copy).
**What was done (each step verified):**
- *Entitlement check — answer is NO, the hard way:* Gemini CLI 0.51.0 installed but its individual Google-login is **sunset** ("migrate to Antigravity"); the user's AI Plus subscription does NOT cover programmatic access. Programmatic door = Gemini API key (AI Studio, free tier). Key lives in the user's env (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, user scope) — set by the user's own hands, never in chat/code/logs (one accidental chat exposure happened mid-setup; that key was **revoked and rotated** immediately). API verified live: HTTP 200, 50 models listed.
- *Backend (`040e713`):* `analyst.py` `_generate_gemini` → `gemini-flash-latest:generateContent` via curl header auth; `process(markdown, backend=)`; identical chunking/fence/reject; code-fence unwrap for Flash's markdown habit; `--backend {local,gemini}` wired through `convert_and_ship.py`.
- *Live fence test (agent book, 26 498 chars):* **7/7 chunks passed, 4/4 embeds, 0 stray tokens, 141.9 s = 186.7 chars/s — ~35% faster than local (138)**. Meta records backend + model in frontmatter.
- *Pre-flight estimator:* `analyst.preflight(chars)` returns the Tauri card JSON — est_tokens (chars/4), per-backend ETAs from measured all-in throughput, `gpu_busy` (nvidia-smi, >2 GiB threshold), privacy labels ("100% air-gapped" vs "cloud routing"), honest cost line ("API free tier — NOT covered by AI Plus, verified 2026-07-19"). Estimator's Gemini ETA for the test doc: 142 s vs 141.9 s actual.
**Verification:** fence counts/stray-token scans on live output; measured wall times; preflight JSON inspected against measurements. §4 accounting over `ee1baeb..HEAD`: `windows-converter/*` in the feat commit; CLAUDE_README in this row. CHANGELOG still deferred to the widget-integration session (component remains pre-widget).
**Boundaries honored:** no Tauri card yet (next session); no ThinkPad work; key never touched repo, logs, or memory.
**Next for Desktop:** the Tauri pre-flight card (poll a pending-analyst queue dir, render preflight JSON, route on click) — first control-room panel; then the Convert (GPU) tile. **Next for ThinkPad:** unchanged (enrichment consumer, user-gated).

### 2026-07-19 — Desktop agent Session 17 (Claude Code / Fable) — drop-folder watcher live; both analyst backends book-proven
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows). **Plan committed `aaef944`.** User asleep for the close; results also left in the Desktop messages folder.
**What was done (each step verified):**
- *Estimator hardening (`b72cbe8`):* `preflight` now returns `est_chunks`, a **free-tier window warning** (>18 chunks → "throttling likely, local recommended"; threshold from the live 429 body: metric `generate_content_free_tier_requests`, limit 20 on gemini-3.5-flash), a `recommendation` field (over-window→local; gpu_busy→gemini; else user's choice), and a gemini ETA that includes the RPM pacing floor. Verified: 7-chunk doc → rec=gemini (GPU was busy), no warning; 43-chunk doc → rec=local + warning, gemini ETA (1470 s) honestly loses to local (1232 s).
- *Gemini rate-limit hardening (`2976469`, earlier tonight):* unpaced 47-chunk run melted into 41 fast API failures (57 s) — diagnosis via live 429 probe; fix = 13 s pacing + backoff retry on 429/5xx + meta split `chunks_failed` (API) vs `chunks_rejected` (fence). Graceful degradation held: every failed chunk shipped as its original.
- *User decision recorded:* declined the $20 API credit minimum — **routing policy: small docs (≤18 chunks) may go Gemini free tier; books route local.** The card should present, not pressure.
- *Beer book, local analyst (full run):* 47 chunks → **44 passed, 3 fence-rejected (qwen3 touched embeds; originals shipped), 0 failed**, 621 s analyst leg. Output: 36/36 embeds, 0 stray tokens, "unexpect edly"→"unexpectedly" healed; the one surviving "atmos phere" sits inside a rejected chunk — the audit trail works. Bundle: anchor `…West Sussex IS (1)`, frontmatter `backend: local`. Gemini twin of the agent book also exists (anchor `…工程实践 (1)`, 7/7). Both backends now have real-book artifacts.
- *`watch_and_convert.py` (`b72cbe8`) + E2E:* poll watcher on `C:\Users\Bndit\ml\library\drop` (dotfile skip, size-stability wait, sequential single-flight = Marker/Ollama never overlap, `.gpu-lock` busy signal, done/failed archiving, `analyst-mode.txt` toggle file re-read per conversion — off|local|gemini). Live E2E: dropped the agent-book PDF → detected ~20 s → converted+shipped 52 s → ThinkPad `EXPORT-SKIP 21bfdffc` → staging 0 → source archived to done/. **The Desktop conveyor front door is real: drop a PDF, it ends up in the vault (or dedup-skips), no human in the loop.**
**Verification:** watcher.log + converter.log line pairs; fence counts on both book artifacts; estimator JSON on small/big inputs. §4 accounting over `aaef944..HEAD`: windows-converter/* in the two feat commits; CLAUDE_README this row. CHANGELOG: still rides with the widget session (S18) as agreed.
**Boundaries honored:** no widget UI (user must be present for look-and-feel decisions — their factory, their aesthetics); no ThinkPad-side changes (its exporter consumed foreign bundles untouched, again).
**Next for Desktop (S18, kickstart prompt in the Desktop messages folder):** the Tauri pre-flight card + Convert (GPU) tile — render `analyst.preflight()` JSON, per-segment toggles, route on click; wire the tile to the drop folder; CHANGELOG entry for windows-converter. **Next for ThinkPad:** enrichment consumer (needs coordination message; user-gated).

### 2026-07-19 — Desktop agent Session 18 (Claude Code / Fable) — the pre-flight analyst card is REAL
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD (Windows). *Protocol note:* no separate open-plan commit — the user green-lit S18 verbally immediately after S17 closed ("do the widget pre-flight card to your best ability"), and the plan lived in the S17 close + Desktop-message kickstart. Everything else per protocol.
**What was done (each step verified):**
- *Queue mechanics (`convert_and_ship.py`):* `--defer-analyst` converts + anchors + parks the bundle in `<gpu_pipeline_dir>\pending\<sha16>\` with a `<sha16>.json` card (bundle name, source, state, `analyst.preflight()` data); `--resume <id> --backend local|gemini|none` applies the link-fenced analyst in place (frontmatter + manifest updated, analyst-stamped anchor copy), ships, and clears the queue — failures flip the card to `failed` with the error for a retry click. Watcher analyst-mode gains **`ask`** (now the live default).
- *Rust (`preflight.rs` + config + main):* `preflight_list` (reads card JSONs raw — Python stays the single schema owner), `preflight_decide` (validates id/backend, spawns the resume **detached** with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` — a 10-minute analyst must never block the UI). Three new `serde(default)` config keys: `gpu_pipeline_dir`, `gpu_python_exe`, `gpu_converter_dir` — feature hidden when unset, the per-segment-toggle pattern. `cargo fmt` + `clippy -D warnings` clean.
- *UI (`index.html`/`styles.css`/`main.js`):* `#preflight-cards` between tiles and vault bar, styled in the W8 Claude Code language (near-black, terracotta, monospace, ✳). Per card: name row, meta line (chunks · ~tokens · GPU free/busy), amber free-tier warning when over the window, red error row on failure, three route buttons — 🔒 Local ~ETA / ☁ Flash ~ETA / Ship as-is — with the estimator's recommendation getting the terracotta border. Working state spins the spark + locks buttons. Poll 15 s, tightens to 4 s after a click; queue-clear triggers the vault fast-poll (card → ship → glow → Add to Library, the full conveyor visible). Window height = 224 + 76/card via `core:window:allow-set-size` (added to capabilities).
- *Verified without burning tokens on screenshots:* backend chain proven by CLI with the exact argv the buttons spawn — defer (card written: 7 chunks, `state: pending`, honest empty recommendation with GPU free) → resume `--backend none` → SHIPPED → ThinkPad `EXPORT-SKIP 21bfdffc` → queue 0. Release build clean; widget restarted on it and running; **a live card was left parked** (agent book, re-deferred) so the user's first morning look shows the real thing.
- *CHANGELOG:* the deferred `windows-converter/` + S18 widget entry landed (Unreleased → Added).
**Usage-awareness (user asked):** one batched read of all six widget sources, zero browser screenshots (native window; CLI-simulated the button path instead), design decided once, edits batched — the session's context cost stayed in code-and-logs, not pixels.
**Boundaries honored:** no ThinkPad changes; bundle format untouched; every new piece toggleable (config keys empty → invisible).
**Next for Desktop:** user's morning: click the waiting card (any route — "Ship as-is" is free) and watch the conveyor run tile-to-Library; then S19 candidates: Convert (GPU) tile in `transfer.rs` (local drop-dir move), widget-managed watcher lifecycle, ETA ranges. **Next for ThinkPad:** enrichment consumer (user-gated; schema-constrained outputs per the injection note).

### 2026-07-19 — Desktop agent Session 19 (Claude Code / Fable) — control-room design committed
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD. **Plan `f75f867`.** Live co-design with the user (their first card click ran the full loop: local analyst → ship → EXPORT-SKIP → queue clear).
**Done:** `docs/13-control-room-design.md` — the projection principle (user doctrine: the widget is a second source of truth, a projection of the pipeline/git, "conventional and pragmatic, but with taste"; all state on disk, Python owns schemas, widget renders); the line grammar (chips through Drop▸Convert▸Analyst▸Ship▸Library; card = chip at a decision gate; terracotta = exclusively "your hand required"); stations/levers incl. the 4-position analyst gate + remember-my-choice rules; two-engines rationale (Marker = switches-only stamping press; analyst = program slot, prompt-file personas in `windows-converter/prompts/`, fence as station infrastructure); Marker-visibility fix (Convert station, density toggle); metrics doctrine (numbers on levers — free-tier bar on the ☁ button; rolling rates; shift report; fence saves shown as protections); receipts/lineage from existing frontmatter; Obsidian+ZenNotes launcher icons; the events.jsonl keystone + widget-owned watcher lifecycle; build order S20/S21/S22.
**Verification:** doc matches the chat design conversation point-for-point. §4: docs/13 + CLAUDE_README only — this row.
**Next for Desktop:** S20 foundation (events stream, watcher lifecycle, shift line, prompt-file programs). **Next for ThinkPad:** unchanged (enrichment consumer, user-gated).

### 2026-07-19 — Desktop agent Session 20 (Claude Code / Fable) — foundation shift: programs, events, lifecycle, shift line
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD. **Plan `66d5f19`.**
**Done (each verified):**
- *Programs:* prompt extracted to `windows-converter/prompts/readability.txt`; `analyst.process(..., program=)` loads prompt files; meta/frontmatter record the program. The analyst is now formally a program slot (docs/13) — new jobs are new text files.
- *Event stream:* `events.py` (best-effort JSON-line append to `<gpu_pipeline_dir>\events.jsonl`); emitters across the pipeline: intake detected/failed, convert probe/converted (with s/page), gate pending/resolved/failed, analyst start/done (with fence counts), ship shipped/failed. Live trail verified over a full defer→resume cycle: probe→converted→pending→shipped→resolved, timestamped with metrics — the shift report, receipts, and rolling rates all derive from this one file now.
- *Widget lifecycle:* `watcher.rs` — the widget autostarts watch_and_convert.py when configured (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), a titlebar power dot shows/toggles it (green hum = running, grey = stopped — deliberately not terracotta per the docs/13 color law), and `on_window_event(Destroyed)` kills it with the window (in-flight conversions run to completion — documented). **Verified live: fresh widget launch spawned the watcher itself (pid observed).** The manual console ritual is gone.
- *Shift line:* `events.rs` `shift_summary` (today counts + tail; UTC date via civil-from-days, no date crate) rendered in a new quiet `#shift` line — "shift: N converted · N analyzed (M protected) · N shipped" — fence saves surfaced as protections per doctrine.
- `cargo fmt` + `clippy -D warnings` clean; release build; widget restarted on it.
**§4 accounting `66d5f19..HEAD`:** windows-converter/* + windows-widget/* in the feat commit (CHANGELOG: S20 rides under the S18 Unreleased entry's feature family; formal entry folds in at the next release cut); CLAUDE_README this row.
**Next for Desktop:** S21 — the line view (chips through stations, Convert-station visibility, station toggles, reader launcher icons). **Next for ThinkPad:** unchanged.

### 2026-07-19 — Desktop agent Session 21 (Claude Code / Fable) — the line is visible
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD. **Plan `39d6a75`.**
**Done (each verified):** `line.rs` — one `line_state` read (drop-waiting count, converting name from `.gpu-lock`, failed count, last-shipped from the events tail) + `analyst_mode_get/set` (projects `analyst-mode.txt`; ask/local/gemini/off) + `open_reader` (config-allowlisted exe/URI) + `open_failed_tray`. UI: the docs/13 station strip `▚ drop ▸ ⚙ convert ▸ ✳ gate ▸ ⇈ ship ▸ ▤ library` above the cards — Convert shows the piece in the press (green when active), the gate shows its mode and flips terracotta only when cards wait (the color law holds), Drop shows a clickable amber `+N✗` when the failed tray has pieces; gate click cycles the 4 modes; Obsidian ◆ / ZenNotes ◈ titlebar launchers (config keys `reader_obsidian`/`reader_zennotes`, live config set: obsidian:// URI + ZenNotes.exe). Window reflow accounts for the strip. `clippy -D warnings` clean; release build; widget restarted (watcher auto-spawned again).
**§4 `39d6a75..HEAD`:** windows-widget/* in the feat commit; CLAUDE_README this row.
**Next:** S22 (same sitting): receipts, auto-route rule, ETA ranges from rolling event rates.

### 2026-07-19 — Desktop agent Session 22 (Claude Code / Fable) — the judgment layer
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD. *(Plan folded into the S21 open — same sitting, user directive "continue until done done".)*
**Done (each verified):**
- *ETA ranges:* `analyst.eta_range()` computes typical/slow (median + ~p10) from the event stream's measured analyst rates per backend (fallback to constants under 3 samples); the pacing floor still clamps Gemini. preflight now emits `eta_range_s`; the card renders "~2m–4m". Live check on a 170k-char doc: gemini [911, 1518]s from real history — the estimates now *learn*.
- *Remember-my-choice:* `rules.json` (`auto_local_over_chunks`) — written by a checkbox that appears only on big-doc cards (docs/13: variety on first encounter, automation after); `defer()` applies the rule and auto-routes local with a `gate/auto_routed` event instead of parking. Widget writes intent; the pipeline decides — projection preserved.
- *Receipts:* ⇈ ship-station click → `last_receipt` gathers the last shipped bundle's chain (pages @ s/page · backend passed✓/protected🛡 · duration) from events into the status line.
- *Failed tray:* S21's `+N✗` amber count + click-through (Explorer) — closed as part of this pair of sessions.
- `clippy -D warnings` clean (one `map_or`→`is_some_and` fix); release build.
- **Sharp edge found:** `Stop-Process` on the widget skips the Destroyed handler → orphaned watcher (observed two pythons; swept). Normal window close is safe. Future: watcher PID file + startup sweep.
**§4 `7635e1a..HEAD`:** windows-widget/* + windows-converter/* in the feat commit; CLAUDE_README this row.
**Next:** docs/14 (mobile projection design, think-only) then wrap. **ThinkPad:** unchanged.

### 2026-07-19 — Desktop agent Session 23 (Claude Code / Fable) — docs/14 remote projection (think-only)
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD. Design analysis only, per the user's "think about it once done remodeling": `docs/14-remote-projection.md` — verdict FEASIBLE (the tailnet is the transport, the docs/13 projection principle means the phone is just a second projector over the same on-disk truth). **Corrections to the relayed Gemini plan recorded:** host = ThinkPad (always-on; user's own version was right), not a "two-node HA cluster" (Desktop is duty-cycled — the UI must honestly show "plant offline"), laptop is NOT the heavy worker (~5 tok/s measured, Phase 3), and no new task framework — the directory queues + watcher + sha-dedup already are one; the phone needs an HTTP door, not a backend. Phases: A read-only projection (tailscale serve + state sync), B submit/route only (pull-model mobile-inbox + decision files), C maybe. Security: tailnet-bound only, no arbitrary commands, size-capped allowlisted uploads. Build is ThinkPad-side and user-gated.
**§4:** docs/14 + CLAUDE_README this row. **Next:** user reviews the S21/S22 widget live + docs/14; ThinkPad enrichment consumer + Phase A when green-lit.

### 2026-07-19 — Desktop agent Session 24 (Claude Code / Fable) — the launch-context bug, hunted and fixed
**Machine:** DESKTOP-OBTQIRD. Debugging session, user reporting "icons disappeared / Library stuck Checking…".
**The hunt (recorded because the misdirections teach):** (1) Red herring #1 — the Claude app's preview pane had auto-opened the widget's index.html as a static snapshot; the user's screenshots of the "broken widget" were partly THIS mirage (no JS → no icons, default station values). (2) Red herring #2 — a filesystem overlay/sandbox theory (seeded by an earlier gemini.cmd anomaly) was disproven by the user's own Test-Path run. (3) Real signal: identical exe, identical config — instances launched from harness shells boot perfectly (boot-log beacons, watcher spawns); instances launched from the user's shortcut write nothing, spawn nothing, and vault_check hangs at "Checking…". (4) Root cause: **Explorer hands shortcut-launched apps the LOGIN-time environment** — every PATH entry added since login (a lot, today) is missing, so the widget's git→tailscale-ssh and other spawns lived in a different world than shell launches. A windowless app's ssh also had a live prompt-deadlock risk.
**The fix (`in this commit`):** `hydrate_env_from_registry()` at widget boot — reads Machine+User PATH (REG_EXPAND_SZ expansion included) and GEMINI_API_KEY from the registry and sets them process-wide, making every launch context identical by construction; `vault.rs` git calls get `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` + null stdin (fail fast, never hang a windowless app); `debug_log` boot-beacon channel (JS → `widget-boot.log`) + window.onerror surfacing + DOM-measured window autosizing (kills the scrollbar that clipped titlebar icons) — all kept as permanent instrumentation. Also: WebView2 profile swept once (dev.fileportal.widget), shortcuts rebuilt with proper working dir + icon, stale Obsidian vault-name URI fixed after the user's vault rename.
**Verified:** clippy -D warnings clean; fixed build boots healthy from a fresh launch (beacons complete, watcher spawned, readers configured). **Morning test for the user: launch from the Desktop shortcut — if beacons appear in widget-boot.log, case closed; if not, next suspect is Malwarebytes exclusions (add the widget exe + C:\Users\Bndit\ml).**
**§4:** windows-widget/* in the fix commit; CLAUDE_README this row.
